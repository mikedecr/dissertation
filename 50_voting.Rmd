# How District-Party Ideology Affects Primary Election Outcomes: Combining Subposteriors for Honest Bayesian Causal Inference {#ch:voting}

```{r stopper, eval = TRUE, cache = FALSE, include = FALSE}
knitr::knit_exit()
```

What is the research question

- do more ideological district-parties elect more ideological primary candidates?
    - CF of general election nominee as f(ideology)
        - similar to Clinton (2006)
        - problem: selects on the DV, don't know the alternatives
    - primary winner as f(ideology, CFscore)
        - what's the effect of CFScore on winning (could be nonlinear)
        - how does local ideology change that?
- stratify on primary type?
- stratify in open seats?

What's the plan?

- conditional logit vs. Hainmueller et al. OLS choice?
- interact candidate and group ideal point: how does p(win) change?
- concern: is the CF data shit? 
    - estimate victory among incumbents running for reelection, what's p(win)?
    - is there not enough data?

covariates:

- what is fixed within choice set?
    - ideal points
    - party of incumbent
    - cycle

    
- @thomsen:2014:moderate-candidates
    - moderates less likely to run the less they "fit" the party (farther from CFscore median)
    - ideological positioning in the form of running vs. not.
    - _we don't see variation because of a self-selection process?_
    - candidates are compared to the party, not to partisan voters (district measures of voters are cross-party)
- @porter-treul:2020:primary-experience
    - increasing number of inexperienced candidates running in primaries
    - not an obvious pattern about the ideological extremity of inexperienced candidates, not always more extreme than experienced incumbents.
    - relation weakens because inexperienced candidates aren't great at positioning themselves (but maybe incumbents are better?)
    - when inexperienced candidates win, they tend to be more ideologically extreme than experienced candidates win
- @thomsen:2020:ideology-gender 
    - no (significant) evidence that ideologyâ€“victory relationship is different for men and women (but the interaction pt estimates are comparable in size to main effects)
    - Dem women are more liberal than men, slight advantage in primaries


    

## Machine Learning and Causal Inference


ML is basically just different methods for $E[Y | X]$


### Why ML and Causal Inference

ID assumptions are all about $E[Y | X]$.

- models are post-identification
- if we have to model, we like robustness and flexibility
- we are specification and functional form dependences


Problems:

- don't know the covariates
- even if we did, don't know the model



Solution: ML

- regularization and other covariate selection methods (not necessarily the purview of "machine learning")
- many models are set up for interactions, nonlinearities
- The causal models themselves are derived in terms of expectations, not in terms of regression functions.



### how does ML work?

workflow: 

- model tuning, train/test split
- penalize overfitting
- regularization and shrinkage priors



### Bayesian causal ML

Notation:

- model predictions are inherently posterior predictions


Natural analogs:

- ridge
- lasso
- extensions


Benefits:

- uncertainty in ML predictions has been a problem
- Bayes gives a straightforward, unified framework for characterizing uncertainty in model parameters (feeding forward into model predictions)



- handles non-identifiability in certain models pretty naturally!




## Bias and Variance in Causal Identification


### Regularization and Shrinkage Priors

Regular parameterization:
\begin{align}
  y_{g} &= \tau\theta_{g} + \mathbf{x}^{\intercal}_{g}\beta + \epsilon_{g}
\end{align}

Orthogonalized parameterization:
\begin{align}
  \theta_{g} &= \mathbf{x}^{\intercal}_{g}\gamma_{1} + \nu_{g}
  y_{g} &= \tau\left(\theta_{g} - \hat{\theta}_{g}\right)_ + \mathbf{x}^{\intercal}_{g}\gamma_{2} + \epsilon_{g}
\end{align}

In an unbiased regression, estimates of $\tau$ would be identical. With regularization applied to the covariate effects, however, the estimates would differ. By explicitly modeling $\theta_{g}$ as a function of $\mathbf{x}_{g}$ and residualizing, we explicitly make all of the identifying variation $\theta_{g} - \mathrm{E}\left[\theta_{g} \mid \mathbf{x_{g}}\right]$ independent of the regression function, allowing shrinkage in the selection model to behave freely without biasing the estimate of $\tau$ by direct consequence. The researcher is then able to set up whatever priors on $\tau$ make sense. 



### Neyman Orthogonalization

We can regularize in the first stage, then we try to be more agnostic in the second stage?




## Empirical Setup

### Data

### Neural Network Choice Model



Regression with Gaussian errors:
\begin{align}
  (\#eq:normal-reg)
  y_{i} 
  &\sim \text{Normal}\left(
    \mathbf{x}^{\intercal}_i\beta, %_ 
    \sigma 
  \right)
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ is a $P$-vector of predictors for unit $i$, and $\beta$ is a $P$-vector of coefficients.

We write a one-layer neural network with slightly more general notation that evokes a basis-function interpretation of a regression model:
\begin{align}
  (\#eq:normal-nn)
  y_{i} &\sim 
    \text{Normal}\left(
      \eta\right(\mathbf{x}_{i}\left) %_
      \boldsymbol{\alpha},
      \sigma
    \right)
\end{align}
where $\eta\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right)$ is a neural network basis function of $\mathbf{x}_{i}$ with coefficients $\alpha$. This basis function is specified as a transformed regression of the predictors,
\begin{align}
  (\#eq:nn-prediction)
  \eta\left(\mathbf{x}_{i}\right) %_
    &= \text{tanh}\left(
    \mathbf{x}_{i}^{\intercal}%_
    \mathbf{\omega}
  \right)
\end{align}
which is commonly referred to as a "neuron" in the neural network parlance. The neuron basis differs from linear regression in two ways. First, the coefficients $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ contain $M$ columns rather than $1$ column as in simple regression. The resulting linear combination $\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\intercal}\mathbf{\omega}$ is therefore a $1 \times M$. This is a generalization of regression, and if $M = 1$, the network essentially reduces to linear regression as $\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\intercal}\mathbf{\omega}$ would be a scalar prediction for unit $i$. The second innovation is an element-wise transformation of $\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\intercal}\mathbf{\omega}$ using the hyperbolic tangent function, which is a scaled logistic function.^[
  Traditionally, the hyperbolic tangent function is written as $\text{tanh}\left(x\right) = \dfrac{e^{x} - e^{-x}}{e^{x} + e^{-x}} = \dfrac{e^{2x} - 1}{e^{2x} + 1}$. It is related to the logistic function by $\text{tanh}\left(x\right) = 2g(2x) - 1$, where $g(\cdot)$ is the standard logistic function. The hyperbolic tangent function is more commonly used for neural networks than the standard logistic function because its output lies in the interval $(-1, 1)$ rather than $(0, 1)$. This is convenient for certain neural network models that "deactivate"

The conditional mean is given by $\text{tanh}\left(\mathbf{x}^{T}_{i}\boldsymbol{\omega}\right)\boldsymbol{\alpha}$. The predictor matrix $\mathbf{x}^{\intercal}_{i}$, instead of being multiplied by a vector of coefficients, is multiplied by a $P \times M$ matrix of coefficients $\boldsymbol{\omega}$, resulting in a $1 \times M$ matrix that is nothing more than $M$ linear regression functions of the form
