# The Constituency Decides: Preferences over Ideological Alternatives {#ch:voting}

What's the plan?

- conditional logit vs. Hainmueller et al. OLS choice
- interact candidate and group ideal point: how does p(win) change?
- concern: is the CF data shit? 
    - estimate victory among incumbents running for reelection, what's p(win)?
    - is there not enough data?

covariates:

- what is fixed within choice set?
    - ideal points
    - party of incumbent
    - cycle
