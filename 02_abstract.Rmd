# Abstract {-}

Conventional wisdom surrounding primary elections in the United States holds that primary competition is a standout reason why classic predictions from formal models of elections---candidates should take ideological positions near the district's median voter---fail to manifest in the real world.
Because partisan candidates must win their party's nomination before advancing to the general election, and primary voters tend to hold non-median beliefs on issues of public policy, candidates may feel stronger incentives to take strong partisan stances on issues to appease their primary electorates than they feel to take moderate stances to appease the general electorate.

This dissertation tests this theory by employing a novel measure of _district-party ideology_, the ideological preferences of Democratic and Republican partisans in each district, estimated with a Bayesian group-level itemâ€“response model.
Under the assumptions of structural causal models, I find that primary candidates position themselves to match the ideological preferences of their primary electorates, even controlling for the level of general election competition in their district.
Primary voters, meanwhile, prefer primary candidates that broadly represent the ideological "core" of their party, but I find little evidence that primary voters discriminate much between relative ideologues or relative moderates except in extreme cases.
This project also establishes and exemplifies a Bayesian framework for estimating causal effects, which is undeveloped in political science but is valuable for estimating causal effects using structural models and data estimated from measurement models.
