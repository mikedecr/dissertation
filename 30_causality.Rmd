This might need to be chapter 2!!!! 

- The model has a discussion of priors that might feel out of place
  without first couching it in a viewpoint of Bayes for the project.
- Is there only one viewpoint? No? 
- The model is a "pragmatic Bayes" (MCMC for fitting, structural priors),
  whereas the causal inf stuff is mixed in its view.
  Sometimes its "normalizing Bayes" (information for sensitivity testing),
  other times is merely "structural" WIPs. 
  Maybe one thing to articulate (to myself, to others) is a position on how
  structural priors make us think about properties of Bayes estimators.
  (in the RDD case, the OLS model is consistent but we aren't in asymptopia.
   How else do we evaluate the properties of the Bayes estimator
   when we include structural information?)

------------------------->

Before I employ the estimates of party-public ideology obtained in Chapter \@ref(ch:model), this chapter discusses a Bayesian view of causal inference.
This framework addresses two major themes in the empirical problems that I confront later in the project, as well as several other minor themes.

First, this project views causal inference as a problem of posterior predictive inference.
Causal models are tools for inferences about missing data: what we would observe if a treatment variable were set to a different value.
The unobserved data are "unobserved potential outcomes" in the Rubin causal framework or "counterfactual outcomes" in the Pearl framework [@rubin:2005:potential-outcomes; @pearl:2009:causality].
Causal inference can be Bayesian if the target of interest is the probability distribution of unobserved potential outcomes (or the probability distribution of any causal estimand), conditioning on the observed data.
In this chapter, I will argue that this is what researchers are implicitly trying to obtain, even if implicitly, nearly all of the time.

Second, the Bayesian approach incorporates uncertainties about the key independent variable in this project.
Causal estimands (to use the Rubin terminology) are comparisons of potential outcomes are two hypothetical values of a treatment, usually a unit's outcome under an _observed_ treatment versus an _unobserved_ treatment.
The data in this project frustrate the typical structure of a causal estimand because the treatment value of interest---policy ideology in a districit-party public---is not observed.
Instead, it is estimated up to a probability distribution specified by the measurement model in Chapter \@ref(ch:model).
Uncertainty about the effect of setting district-party ideology to some new value $\theta'$ therefore contains multiple sources of uncertainty: statistical uncertainty about the estimated causal effect, and measurement uncertainty about the original value of $\theta$ before a causal intervention.
Bayesian analysis provides the statistical machinery to quantify uncertainty in these causal effects as if they were any other posterior quantity, by marginalizing the posterior distribution over any nuisance parameters.

This chapter unpacks these issues according to the following outline.
First, I review the notation and terminology for causal modeling in empirical research, where data and causal estimands are posed in terms of "potential outcomes" or "counterfactual" observations. 
I then describe a Bayesian reinterpretation of these models, which uses probability distributions to quantify uncertainty about causal effects and counterfactual data, conditional on observed data.
Because Bayesian modeling remains largely foreign to political science, I spend much of the chapter explaining what a Bayesian appraoch to causal inference means with theoretical and practical justifications: how priors are inescapable for many causal claims, how priors provide valuable structure to improve the estimation of causal effects, and practical advice for constructing and evaluating Bayesian causal models.
Finally, I provide examples of Bayesian causal modeling by replicating and extending published studies in political science, showing where priors add value to causal inference.



## Overview of Key Concepts


### Causal Models {#sec:causal-inf}

As an area of scientific development, _causal inference_ refers to the formal modeling of causal effects, the assumptions required to identify causal effects, and research designs that make these assumptions plausible.
Scientific disciplines, especially social sciences, have long been interested in substantiating causal claims using data, but the rigorous definition of the full causal model and identifying assumptions distinguishes the current causal inference movement from other informal approaches.

Contemporary approaches to causal inference span several fields, most notably in economics, epidemiology, and computer science.
The dominant modeling approach to causal inference in political science is rooted in a notation of _potential outcomes_ [@rubin:1974:potential-outcomes; @rubin:2005:potential-outcomes].
This "Rubin model" formalizes the concept of a causal effect by first defining a space of hypothetical outcomes.
The outcome variable $Y$ for unit $i$ is a function of a treatment variable $A$.
"Treatment" refers only to a causal factor of interest, regardless of whether the treatment is randomly assigned.^[
  Some causal inference literatures refer to treatments as "exposures," which may feel more broadly applicable to settings beyond experiments. For this project, I make no distinction between treatments and exposures.
]
Considering a binary treatment assignment where $A = 1$ represents treatment and $A = 0$ represents control, unit $i$'s outcome under treatment is represented as $Y_{i}(A = 1)$ or $Y_{i}(1)$, and the outcome under control would be $Y_{i}(A = 0)$ or $Y_{i}(0)$.
The benefit of expressing $Y$ in terms of hypothetical values of $A$ allows the causal model to describe, with formal exactitude, the entire space of possible outcomes that result from treatment assignment.
The treatment effect for unit $i$, denoted $\tau_{i}$, is the difference in potential outcomes when changing the treatment status $A_{i}$.
\begin{align}
  \tau_{i} &= Y_{i}(A_{i} = 1) - Y_{i}(A_{i} = 0)
  (\#eq:tau-i)
\end{align}
If $\tau_{i}$ is not $0$, then $A_{i}$ has a causal effect on $Y_{i}$.
Defining the causal model in terms of unit-level effects provides an exact, minimally sufficient definition of a causal effect: $A$ affects $Y$ if the treatment has a nonzero effect _for any unit_.

By establishing this baseline model, the researcher can derive exact statements about causal effects by manipulating the equations that define the space of treatments and outcomes.
A causal model may describe more complex causal effects, such as whether $Y_{i}$ it is observed at all, whether the treatment effect is indirectly mediated by another variable, whether the effect depends on other baseline characterics of units, and so on. 

The entire space of potential outcomes is a hypothetical device. 
Although a causal model defines potential outcomes for every unit under every treatment assignment, it is not possible to observe all of these potential outcomes, since a unit can receive only one treatment, and thus can only take a single outcome value. 
This implies that the individual causal effect ($\tau_{i}$), while a valid feature of the hypothetical causal model, is never actually observed for any unit.
This "fundamental problem of causal inference" is the core philosophical problem in causal inference; the researcher never observes a unit under more than one treatment status, so they can never make causal claims with observed data alone [@holland:1986:causal-inf].
Instead, causal claims are possible only by imposing assumptions on the data.
These "identification assumptions" specify the conditions under which observed can be used to describe what the data would look like if units received counterfactual treatments [@keele:2015:causal-inf].
For observational causal inference, it is common to invoke the following four assumptions. 
The _consistency_ assumption states that when a unit receives a treatment, the outcome that we observed is the potential outcome for that unit under that treatment.
\begin{align}
  \text{Consistency: } Y_{i} = Y_{i}(A_{i} = a) \mid A_{i} = 1
  (\#eq:consistency-assumption)
\end{align}
In other words, observing the outcome does not affect the outcome, and there are no hidden versions of treatment that are not defined in the causal model. 
The _no interference_ assumption states that unit $i$'s potential outcome depends only on $i$'s treatment status, not on any other units' treatment status.
\begin{align}
  \text{No Interference: } Y_{i}\left(A_{i}\right) = Y_{i}\left(A_{1}, A_{2}, \ldots, A_{n}\right)
  (\#eq:interference-assumption)
\end{align}
The consistency and no-interference assumptions are sometimes grouped into a single assumption, called the "stable unit treatment value assumption" [or SUTVA, @rubin:1980:comment-randomization].
The _conditional independence_ assumption (CIA), also known as conditional "ignorability" or conditional "unconfoundedness," states that potential outcomes are independent of treatment status conditional on a unit's membership in a specific stratum of covariates $X_{i} = x$.
\begin{align}
   \text{Conditional Independence: } 
   Y_{i}\left(A_{i} = 1\right), \; Y_{i}\left(A_{i} = 0\right) \ind 
   A_{i} \mid X_{i} = x
   (\#eq:ignorability-assumption)
\end{align}
The CIA is essentially an assumption about unit-level expectations under counterfactuals.
Within stratum $X_{i} = x$, any observed $Y_{i}$ in the treatment group are independent from the $Y_{i}(1)$ potential outcome values for units in the control group.
This assumption is violated by self-selection processes or other confounding affects that sort units into treatment statuses in a way that is correlated with their potential outcomes.
The CIA is usually invoked alongside a _positivity_ assumption,
\begin{align}
   \text{Positivity: } 0 < p\left(A_{i} = a \mid X_{i} = x\right) < 1, \; \forall a \in \mathcal{A}, \; \forall x \in \mathcal{X}
   (\#eq:positivity-assumption)
\end{align}
where $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{X}$ are respectively the spaces of possible treatments and covariate strata.
Positivity stipulates nonzero probability of treatment statuses within each strata, ensuring that causal inferences are conducted only on units that could conceivably have received other treatment statuses.^[
  See @liao-et-al:2019:post-predict-time-varying for Bayesian causal estimation for "overlapping populations" under violations of strict positivity.
]
Conditional independence and positivity assumptions are essential for conducting causal inference using methods of covariate adjustment.

All together, these assumptions enable inferences about potential outcomes, which aren't always observed, using only observed data.
For instance, from these assumptions it follows that the average $Y$ values observed at $A = a$ are equal to the average potential outcomes that we would obtain by setting $A = a$ ourselves, within strata $X = x$:
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    \E{Y_{i} \mid A_{i} = a, X_{i} = x}
      &= \E{Y_{i}(A = a) \mid A_{i} = a, X_{i} = x} \\
      &= \E{Y_{i}(A = a) \mid X_{i} = x}
  \end{split}
  (\#eq:assumption-implications)
\end{align}
The first line of \@ref(eq:assumption-implications) equates observed outcomes given treatment to potential outcomes under an imposed treatment, which is enabled by SUTVA (consistency and no interference).
Conditional independence allows us to suppresses the explicit conditioning on $A_{i} = a$ in the second line, and positivity is implied by referring generically to treatment level $a$ and covariate stratum $x$.

Implications derived from identification assumptions are typically posed in terms of expectations about potential outcomes, $\E{Y_{i}\left(A_{i}\right)}$, instead of unit-level potential outcomes, $Y_{i}\left(A_{i}\right)$, because unit-level causal heterogeneity is unidentified without additional assumptions [@holland:1986:causal-inf]. 
This is why causal quantities of interest, also known as causal estimands, are usually posed in terms of expectations as well.
This project will generally discuss _conditional average treatment effects_ (CATEs), which are expectations of treatment effects averaged over the population of units within a covariate stratum.
Let $\bar{\tau}(a, a', x)$ be the average effect of setting $A = a$, as opposed to some other value $a'$, within stratum $X = x$.
\begin{align}
  \bar{\tau}(a, a', x) = \E{Y_{i}(a) - Y_{i}(a') \mid X_{i} = x}
  (\#eq:CATE)
\end{align}

When deriving estimands such as the CATE with identification assumptions, it is important to note that assumptions describe minimally sufficient conditions for _nonparametric_ causal identification [@keele:2015:causal-inf]. 
There is no guarantee that linear regression models, or any parametric models, adequately control for confounders.
For this reason, it is important to distinguish causal estimands from estimation methods, the latter of which can introduce statistical assumptions that differ from identification assumptions.

In order to separate the major planks of causal inference methods, I center the discussion of causal inference going forward around a three-part hierarchy of causal methodology.

1. Causal model: the hypothetical model that defines all treatments and potential outcomes at the unit level.
   The causal model is an omniscient view of the causal system, defining individual-level causal effects even though they cannot be observed in real data.
2. Identification assumptions: the assumptions required to identify causal estimands using only the observed data. 
   These assumptions specify how knowledge of observed $Y$ data can be used to make inferences about counterfactual $Y$ data that is not observed.
   Inferences enabled by identification assumptions are typically posed as expectations about counterfactual data, unless further assumptions are specified that relate individual unit effects to average effects.^[
     For instance, a _constant additive effects_ assumption states that all  causal effects are constant for all units and can be combined without interactions [@Rosenbaum:2002:observational-studies].
   ]
   Because inferences are posed as expectations, they are abstractions that follow from analytical derivations and do not depend on statistical estimation approaches.
3. Estimation methods: How do we estimate the expectations derived from the causal model and identification assumptions? Do these estimation methods introduce additional statistical assumptions on top of the identification assumptions?

I lay out this hierarchy for two main reasons.
First, it clarifies why researchers use certain research designs or statistical approaches to overcome particular problems with their data.
Statistical assumptions, we will see, can undermine identification assumptions, which is why causal inference scholars tend to promote estimation strategies that rely on as few additional assumptions as possible [@keele:2015:causal-inf].
One way to avoid these assumptions is to use research designs that eliminate confounding "by design" rather than through statistical adjustment, such as randomized experiments, instrumental variables, regression discontinuity, and difference-in-differences [for instance, @angrist-pischke:2008:mostly-harmless].
If researchers cannot design away these difficult assumptions, other methods are available to adjust for confounders without as many strict assumptions about the functional form of the causal model as are commonly invoked in parametric regression models.
Causal inference is not synonymous with the new "agnostic statistics" movement [e.g. @aronow-miller:2019:agnostic-statistics], but it is animated by a similar motivation to identify statistical methods that rely on as few fragile assumptions as possible.
For causal inference problems, these methods include matching, doubly robust models, and machine learning methods for estimating flexible conditional expectation functions that are to varying degrees robust to misspecification, nonlinearities, or non-additivities in the data generating process [@sekhon:2009:opiates; @aronow-samii:2016:regression; @hill:2011:bart; @green-kern:2012:bart; @samii-et-al:2016:retrospective-causal-inference-ML; @aronow-miller:2019:agnostic-statistics].
This dissertation will employ machine learning methods, in particular Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), to estimate regression functions that rely less on exact, reduced-form model specification choices.

Second, the three-part hierarchy of causal inference clarifies where my contributions around Bayesian causal estimation will be focused.
As I discuss below, the "easiest way in" for Bayesian methods is through statistical estimation (level 3), since some flexible estimation methods are convenient to implement using Bayesian technologies [@imbens-rubin:1997:bayes-compliance; @ornstein-duck-mayr:2020:GP-RDD].
I push this further by arguing that Bayesian estimation changes the interpretation of the causal model (level 1) by implying a probability distribution over the space of potential outcomes.
This probability distribution allows the researcher to say which causal effects and counterfactual data are more plausible than others, which is a desirable property of causal inference that is not available through conventional inference methods.
The Bayesian approach also has the power to extend the meaning of identification assumptions (level 2) by construing them also as probabilistic rather than fixed features of a causal analysis [@oganisian-roy:2020:bayes-estimation].





### Bayesian Inference {#sec:bayes-inf}

Bayesian reasoning is a contentious and misunderstood topic in empirical political science, so it is important to establish some essential tenets to the approach before melding it with causal modeling.
Bayesian analysis is the application of conditional probability for statistical inference.
Its mechanical underpinnings are uncontroversial, essential building blocks of probability theory: how the probability of an event changes by conditioning on other known information.
Any controversy surrounding Bayesian methods in political science is better understood as a disagreement over which modeling constructs we choose to describe using probabilities.

Whereas many statistical methods begin with a model of data given fixed parameters, Bayesian inference consists of a joint model for all components in a system.
The "joint model" is simply a probability model for more than one event.
For example, suppose that we are interested in the joint probability distribution of age and vote choice in a population.
The joint distribution of these two variables as $p(\mathit{Age}, \mathit{Vote})$, which can be equivalently expressed by factoring it in two ways:
\begin{align}
  p(\mathit{Vote} \mid \mathit{Age})p(\mathit{Age}) 
    &= p(\mathit{Age} \mid \mathit{Vote})p(\mathit{Vote})
  (\#eq:condition-prob-vote-age)
\end{align}
If we observe an individual's vote choice, how does this affect the probability distribution of age? 
Probability theory says that we divide the joint probability by the probability of the conditioning event.
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  \frac{p(\mathit{Vote} \mid \mathit{Age})p(\mathit{Age})}{p(\mathit{Vote})}
   &= \frac{p(\mathit{Age} \mid \mathit{Vote})p(\mathit{Vote})}{p(\mathit{Vote})} \\
  \frac{p(\mathit{Vote} \mid \mathit{Age})}{p(\mathit{Age})}
  &= p(\mathit{Age} \mid \mathit{Vote})
\end{split}
(\#eq:updated-vote-age)
\end{align}
This maneuver reveals Bayes' theorem: the probability of $A$ given $B$, expressed in terms of $B$ given $A$.
Bayes' theorem provides a formal method for rationally updating a joint probability distribution by conditioning on known information.

The Bayesian paradigm of applied statistical modeling applies Bayes' theorem to data $\mathbf{y}$ and parameters $\boldsymbol{\pi}$.
The joint model for the data and the parameters takes the form
\begin{align}
  p(\mathbf{y}, \boldsymbol{\pi}) = p(\mathbf{y} \cap \boldsymbol{\pi}) = p(\mathbf{y} \mid \boldsymbol{\pi})p(\boldsymbol{\pi}),
  (\#eq:joint-model)
\end{align}
where $p(\mathbf{y} \mid \boldsymbol{\pi})$ represents the probability distribution of the data, conditioning on parameters, and $p(\boldsymbol{\pi})$ represents the probability distribution of parameters, marginalizing over the data.
The marginal parameter distribution is usually referred to as a "prior distribution," since it describes the researcher's prior information (or, controversially, prior "beliefs") about the parameter.
The joint model provides machinery for learning about parameters by conditioning the parameters on the data,
\begin{align}
  p(\boldsymbol{\pi} \mid \mathbf{y}) &= \frac{p(\mathbf{y} \mid \boldsymbol{\pi})p(\boldsymbol{\pi})}{p(\mathbf{y})}
  (\#eq:joint-model-post)
\end{align}
also known as obtaining the _posterior distribution_ of the parameters.

These basic concepts of conditional probability and Bayesian updating are not foreign to political science, but it will be important to establish an interpretation of Bayesian thinking and Bayesian modeling that is productive for causal inference. 
This project invokes what @mcelreath:2017:decolonized-bayes calls an "inside view" of Bayesian statistics---Bayesian statistics on its own terms.
The inside view is a response to an "outside view" of Bayesian statistics as penalized maximum likelihood.
Under the outside view, data follow probability distributions, while parameters are fixed.
Bayesian estimation, in turn, is a likelihood model with an additional penalty on the parameters, and because the penalty represents the researcher's subjective beliefs, the penalty feels _ad hoc_ and anti-scientific.
This view of Bayesian statistics is admittedly confusing, and if we take it at face value, it is no wonder that causal inference in political science has largely avoided Bayesian tools other than for computational convenience.

The inside view, as mentioned above, construes a Bayesian model as a joint model for all variables in a system.
The use of the word "variables" to encompass both data and parameters is crucial.
The technology of a Bayesian model does not regard data and parameters as distinct from one another.
They follow the same rules, just as age and vote choice followed the same rules in the above example.
Data and parameters are both instantiations of uncertain processes, with the only semantic difference between the two being that observed variables are called "data" while unobserved variables are called "parameters" [@mcelreath:2017:decolonized-bayes].^[
  The semantic conventions are often sloppier in practice than many researchers would like to think.
  Many analyses use data that summarize lower-level processes, such as per-capita income in U.S or the percentage of women who vote for the Democratic presidential candidate, which behave like random variables in that their values could differ under repeated sampling.
  The semantic distinction between data and parameters has a similar spirit to the @blackwell-et-al:2017:measurement-error view of measurement uncertainty, where "measurement error" falls on a spectrum between fully observed data and missing data.
]
Prior distributions and likelihood functions are the same thing: probability distributions that quantify uncertainty about a variable.
If I were to observe a new data point from a model, I would be unable to predict its value exactly, but some values are more probable than others, given the parameters that condition the data.
The same premise holds for parameters: if I could observe a parameter, I would have been unable to anticipate it exactly, but I could bet that some parameters are more likely than others, given the data that I have already seen.
The joint model for all variables encapsulates the probabilistic relationships between data and parameters.
Starting with the prior model, $p(\mathbf{y}, \boldsymbol{\pi})$, we can condition the model on chosen parameters to obtain a rationalizable distribution of data, $p(\mathbf{y} \mid \boldsymbol{\pi})$.
Or we can condition the model on data to obtain a rationalizable distribution of parameters, $p(\boldsymbol{\pi} \mid \mathbf{y})$. 
@mcelreath:2020:bayes-counting calls these maneuvers "running the model forward" (updating data given parameters) or "running the model backward" (updating parameters given data). 
<!-- It can be helpful to think of the model as a machine with many interlocking parts, where if you crank the machine, the pieces that you choose to constrain will affect which pieces do and do not move. -->


<!------- TO DO ---------
- plot a prior, predictive, and inferential distribution
------------------------->

From the inside view, Bayesian updating proceeds by considering a variety of possible scenarios that create data and evaluating which scenarios are consistent with the data.
The joint prior model, $p(\mathbf{y} \mid \boldsymbol{\pi})p(\boldsymbol{\pi})$ describes an overly broad set of possible configurations of the world. These configurations contain a distribution of possible parameters, $p(\boldsymbol{\pi})$, and possible data given parameters, $p(\mathbf{y} \mid \boldsymbol{\pi})$.
Bayesian updating decides which configurations of the world are consistent with the data and are therefore more plausible.
The plausibility, or posterior probability, of a parameter value is greater if the observed data are more likely to occur under that parameter value versus another value.
In turn, the posterior distribution downweights model configurations that are implausible, or inconsistent with the data [@mcelreath:2020:rethinking-2, chapter 2].
This is an important distinction from non-Bayesian statistical inference, since there can is no formal notion of "plausible parameters given the data" without a posterior distribution, which necessitates a prior distribution.
<!------- TO DO ---------
- is this true?
------------------------->
For causal inference, this means there can be no formal notion of "plausible causal effects" without a probability distribution over causal effects.
The mission in the remainder of this chapter is to establish a framework for causal inference in terms of plausible effects and plausible counterfactuals.

The inside view of Bayesian modeling, and the philosophical unity that it brings to statistical machinery and inference, is possible even if using uninformative prior distributions that are indifferent to possible parameters  _a priori_.
This is how Bayesian methods tend to appear in political science to date, with noninformative priors that exist primarily to facilitate Bayesian computation for difficult estimation problems.
The infamy of Bayesian methods, however, is owed to the ability of the researcher to specify "informative" priors that concentrate probability density on model configurations that are thought to be more plausible even before data are analyzed.
There are many modeling scenarios where this concentration of probability delivers results that are almost unthinkable without prior structure: multilevel models that allocate variance to different layers of hierarchy, highly parameterized models with correlated parameters such as spline regression, and sparse regressions where regularizing priors are used to shrink coefficients and preserve degrees of freedom to overcome the "curse of dimensionality" [@bishop:2006:pattern-rec; @gelman-et-al:2013:BDA].
At the same time, many researchers are skeptical of Bayesian methods because supplying a model with non-data information can be spun as data falsification [@garcia-perez:2019:bayes-data-falsification].
As I elaborate in Section \@ref(sec:causal-priors), it is a mistake to equate flat prior "flatness" with prior "uninformativeness," and there are many legitimate sources of prior information that have nothing to do with subjective beliefs.


<!------- TO DO ---------
- Furthermore, the mere non-flatness of a prior is often less consequential than the parameter's structural relationship to other parameters.
For instance, whether a prior has a scale of $10$ versus $30$ almost always matters less than whether the prior contains hierarchical structure for borrowing information from other groups of data.
It is no coincidence the Bayesian contributions in this dissertation and in other areas of applied statistics are concerned with different prior structures more than the precision of otherwise equal prior structures.

## Bayesian Causal Modeling {#sec:intro-bcm}

Having reviewed the basics of causal models and Bayesian inference, we now turn to a framework for Bayesian causal modeling.
The distinguishing feature of a Bayesian causal model is that the elemental units of the model, the potential outcomes, are given probability distributions.
This probability distribution reflects available causal information that exists outside the current dataset.
Bayesian inference proceeds updating our information about causal effects and counterfactual potential outcomes in light of the observed data.
The headings under \@ref(sec:intro-bcm) introduce this modeling framework at a high level.
I provide a probabilistic interpretation and notation for potential outcomes models (\@ref(sec:po-distributions)), a connection between causal parameters and model parameters (\@ref(sec:what-params)), and a broad justification for the Bayesian interpretation of causal effects (\@ref(sec:why-bcm)).




### Probabilistic Model for Potential Outcomes {#sec:po-distributions}

As with other causal models, we begin at the unit level.
Unit $i$ receives a treatment $A_{i} = a$, with potential outcomes $Y_{i}\left(A_{i} = a\right)$.
Suppose a binary treatment case where $A_{i}$ can take values $0$ or $1$, so the unit-level causal effect is $\tau_{i} - Y_{i}\left(1\right) - Y_{i}\left(0\right)$.
Although $\tau_{i}$ is unidentified, it is possible to estimate population-level causal quantities by invoking identification assumptions.
For instance, the conditional average treatment effect at $X_{i} = x$, $\bar{\tau}(X = x) = \E{Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0) \mid X_{i} = x}$, can be estimated from observed data assuming consistency, non-interference, conditional ignorability, and positivity. 
Suppressing the unit index $i$,
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  \bar{\tau}(X = x) 
      &= \E{Y(A = 1) - Y(A = 0)\mid X = x} \\
      &= \E{Y(A = 1) \mid X = x} - \E{Y(A = 0) \mid X = x} \\
      &= \E{Y \mid A = 1, X = x} - \E{Y \mid A = 0, X = x}
\end{split}
(\#eq:cate-proof)
\end{align}
where the third line is obtained by the identification assumptions.
The identification assumptions connect _causal estimands_ and what I will call _observable estimands_.
Causal estimands are the true causal quantities, but they are unobservable because they are stated as contrasts of potential outcomes.
Observable estimands are the observable analogs of causal estimands and are equivalent to causal estimands if identification assumptions hold.
Other literature refers to observable estimands as "nonparametric estimators" [@keele:2015:causal-inf], but I steer clear of this language because the gap between observable estimands and estimators is important for understanding the contributions of the Bayesian causal approach.

The transition to a Bayesian probabilistic model begins with an acknowledgment that no estimate of the observable estimand, $\E{Y \mid A = a, X = x}$, will be exact. 
The assumptions identify causal effects only in an infinite data regime, where the observable estimand is known exactly.
Inference about causal effects from finite samples, however, requires further statistical assumptions that link the observable estimand to an estimator or model.
<!------- TO DO ---------
- redo with an expectation-level model
------------------------->
Let $f(A_{i}, X_{i}, \boldsymbol{\pi}) + \epsilon_{i}$ be a model for $Y_{i}$ consisting of a function $f(\cdot)$ treatment $A_{i}$, covariates $X_{i}$, and parameters $\boldsymbol{\pi}$, and an error term $\epsilon_{i}$.
We let the systematic component $f(\cdot)$ be a plug-in estimator for $\E{Y \mid A = a, X = x}$.
This setup is similar to any modeling assumption that appears in observational causal inference to link an estimator to the observable estimand, including parametric models for covariate adjustment, propensity models, matching, and more [@acharya-blackwell-sen:2016:direct-effects; @sekhon:2009:opiates].^[
  Although researchers are focusing more attention on estimation methods that focus on these statistical assumptions themselves, either by model ensembles/averages or "robust" models for propensity and response.

We use the statistical model to generate a CATE estimate, $\hat{\bar{\tau}}(X = x)$, by differencing these model predictions over the treatment.

  \bar{\tau}(X = x) 
    &= \E{Y \mid A = 1, X = x} - \E{Y \mid A = 0, X = x} \\
  \hat{\bar{\tau}}(X = x)
    &= \E{f(A_{i} = 1, X_{i}1 = x, \boldsymbol{\pi})
       - f(A_{i} = 0, X_{i} = x, \boldsymbol{\pi})}
\end{split}
(\#eq:cate-f)
\end{align}
Where the second line includes $\hat{\bar{\tau}}$ to indicate that $f(\cdot)$ is an estimator of $\bar{\tau}$.

The Bayesian approach, inspired largely by @rubin:1978:bayesian, confronts the problem with a joint model for data and parameters: $\p{Y, \boldsymbol{\pi}} = \p{Y \mid f(A, U, \boldsymbol{\pi})}\p{\boldsymbol{\pi}}$.
The data are distributed conditional on the statistical model prediction $f(\cdot)$, which conditions on the model parameters $\boldsymbol{\pi}$.
The parameters also have a prior distribution $\p{\boldsymbol{\pi}}$, or a distribution marginal of the data.
These models for data and parameters are added statistical assumptions on top of causal identification assumptions.
The data model is similar to any estimation approach that uses a probability model for errors (e.g. any MLE method or OLS with Normal errors). 
The prior model has no analog in OLS or unpenalized MLE, but this added statistical assumption will be leveraged as a major benefit as we explore Bayesian causal estimation below.

The joint generative model is sufficient to characterize the probability distribution for the conditional average treatment effect as defined in Equation \@ref(eq:cate-f),
\begin{align}
  p(\bar{\tau}(X = x))
    &= \int p\left[
         f(A = 1, X = x, \boldsymbol{\pi}) 
         - f(A = 0, X = x, \boldsymbol{\pi})
         \mid \boldsymbol{\pi}
       \right] 
       \p{\boldsymbol{\pi}}
       \diff{\boldsymbol{\pi}}
  (\#eq:prior-cate)
\end{align}
<!------- TO DO ---------
- should the p(pi) be there?
------------------------->
which is the probability distribution of model contrasts for $A = 1$ versus $A = 0$.
This distribution of model contrasts contains two sources of uncertainty: uncertainty about the data given parameters, and uncertainty over the parameters themselves.
Integrating over $\boldsymbol{\pi}$ in Equation \@ref(eq:prior-cate) marginalizes the distribution with respect to the uncertain parameters. 
Because the integrated parameters are the prior distribution $\p{\boldsymbol{\pi}}$, the expression in \@ref(eq:prior-cate) represents a prior distribution for the CATE.
This is an inherent feature of the Bayesian approach: probability distributions of causal quantities even before data are observed.

Conditioning on the observed data returns the posterior distribution for the CATE...
\begin{align}
  p(\bar{\tau}(X = x) \mid Y)
    &= \int p\left[
         f(A = 1, X = x, \boldsymbol{\pi}) 
         - f(A = 0, X = x, \boldsymbol{\pi})
         \mid \boldsymbol{\pi}, Y
       \right] 
       \p{\boldsymbol{\pi} \mid Y}
       \diff{\boldsymbol{\pi}}
  (\#eq:post-cate)
\end{align}
where we would integrating over the posterior distribution of the parameters, instead of the prior distribution, returns a probability distribution for the CATE $\bar{\tau}$ that reflects Bayesian updating from data $Y$.

The Bayesian causal approach makes sense because it enables _direct inference_ about treatment effects given the data: which effect sizes are "more likely" or "less likely" than others.
Unlike confidence intervals, the posterior distribution enables the researcher to state the probability of a positive treatment effect, or the probability that the treatment effect is likely to be negligible.
Building positive statements about model conclusions is a natural way to think about the scientific aims of any discipline engaged causal inference: the world probably works in this or that way, given this evidence.
Although this sounds banal, it isn't statistically coherent to invoke similar language under a non-Bayesian inference paradigm, since characterizing the plausibility of causal effects can't be evaluated with a posterior distribution, which entails a prior distribution.
Instead, non-Bayesian methods conduct inference by making probability statements about _data_ conditional on hypothesized parameters, not parameters themselves.
Data-focused inference statements (e.g. $p$-values) become conclusions about parameters only after invoking additional decision rules that compress the uncertainty in model results into discrete conclusions.

Another reason why the Bayesian causal modeling approach makes sense is because causal models, at their core, are models for counterfactual data. 
Because the Bayesian model is a _generative_ model for parameters and data, the model contains all machinery required to directly quantify counterfactual potential outcomes using probability distributions.
To see this in action, remember that we can "run the model forward" to create a predictive distribution for $Y$ given the model parameters.
Denote these simulated observations as $\tilde{Y}$ to distinguish them from the data $Y$ that are actually observed.
If we marginalize this predictive distribution with respect to the prior parameters, we obtain a "prior predictive distribution"---the distribution of data we would expect under the prior [@gelman-et-al:2013:BDA].
\begin{align}
  \p{\tilde{Y} \mid A = a, X = x} &= \int \p{\tilde{Y} \mid A = a, X = x, \boldsymbol{\pi}}\p{\boldsymbol{\pi}} \diff{\boldsymbol{\pi}}
  (\#eq:prior-predictive)
\end{align}
We update this distribution by conditioning on new data, delivering a "posterior predictive distribution"—the distribution of data that we expect from the posterior parameters.
\begin{align}
  \p{\tilde{Y} \mid Y, A = a, X = x} &= \int \p{\tilde{Y} \mid A = a, X = x, \boldsymbol{\pi}}\p{\boldsymbol{\pi} \mid Y} \diff{\boldsymbol{\pi}}
  (\#eq:post-predictive)
\end{align}
These predictive distributions are the basis for out-of-sample inference in Bayesian generative models,^[
  Simulations of this sort are possible under any likelihood-based model that posits a generative probability distribution for the data.
  Bayesian predictive distributions are different, however, because they also marginalize over the parameter distribution instead of merely conditioning on fixed parameters.
  This makes Bayesian predictive distributions a more thorough representation of the total statistical uncertainty in the model.
]
and they are the basis for counterfactual inference as well.
Invoking the causal identification assumptions, we can obtain the probability distribution counterfactual data as predictive distributions as well, setting the treatment $A = a$ to some other value $A = a'$. 
Denote these counterfactual predictions $\tilde{Y}'$, which I will subscript $i$ to show that this model implies a probability distribution for individual data points as well as aggregate treatment effects.
\begin{align}
  \p{\tilde{Y}_{i}' \mid Y, A_{i} = a', X_{i} = x} &= \int \p{\tilde{Y}_{i}' \mid A_{i} = a', X_{i} = x, \boldsymbol{\pi}}\p{\boldsymbol{\pi} \mid Y} \diff{\boldsymbol{\pi}}
  (\#eq:counterfactual-predictive)
\end{align}
Stated more simply: if causal models define a space of potential outcomes, then Bayesian causal models are probabilistic representations of the potential outcome space.
Probability densities over potential outcomes are defined in the prior and after conditioning on observed data, and they can be defined all the way to the unit level if the generative model contains a probability density for unit outcomes.^[
  If we can estimate average causal effects with group-level statistics, we can elide the unit-level model in favor of a more robust distributional assumption for the statistics, e.g. the Central Limit Theorem for group means.
  Naturally, models of this type will stop short of defining probability distributions for counterfactual observations, but if will define probability distributions for counterfactual averages.
  In some cases, such as binary outcome data, means in each group are sufficient statistics for the raw data, so the unit level model is implied by the group-level model.
  See Section \@ref(sec:models-for-means) for explanation and examples.
]
In this way, Bayesian causal inference as nothing more remarkable than a missing data model for unobserved counterfactuals [see @rubin:2005:potential-outcomes].

As mentioned above, this is not the first time causal inference has been frames as a Bayesian modeling problem. 
Indeed, the Bayesian interpretation of causal inference and missing counterfactuals is at least as old as @rubin:1978:bayesian.
Although it is rarely invoked in practice today, Rubin writes that "the posterior distribution of causal estimands, obtained from the posterior predictive distribution of the missing potential outcomes...is the most natural way to summarize evidence for a scientific question" [@rubin:2005:potential-outcomes].
Unlike other Bayesian setups, however, this chapter will contain more practical guidance for thinking Bayesianly about causal inference, more synthesis of Bayesian causal innovations from other fields, and more examples of Bayesian causal modeling in practice.









### Bayesian Inference in the Hierarchy of Causal Inference {#sec:bayes-hierarchy}


This section interprets the Bayesian causal inference framework in light of the "hierarchy of causal inference" described in Section \@ref(sec:causal-inf).
The hierarchy helps us account for the ways that Bayesian methods have already been invoked for causal inference in political science and in other fields, and it helps us understand how the Bayesian statistical paradigm reinterprets causal inference more broadly.
To review, the hierarchy consisted of three parts:

1. The causal model: definition of potential outcome space, causal estimands expressed in terms of potential outcomes.
2. Identification assumptions: linkage from causal estimands expressed as potential outcomes to observable estimands expressed using observed data.
3. Estimation: Methods for estimating observable estimands with finite data.

We began our discussion of the Bayesian causal model above by considering a plug-in estimator for an observable estimand that came from a Bayesian statistical model.
Bayes was invoked as "mere estimation," so we began our understanding of Bayesian causal modeling at level 3 of the hierarchy. 
As only an estimation method, a Bayesian estimator (such as a posterior expectation value) doesn't obviously change the meaning of the observable estimand or the causal estimand. 
After all, the estimator exists in the space of real data, unlike a causal estimand that belongs to the hypothetical space of potential outcomes.
Being merely an estimator, we could evaluate the Bayesian model for its bias and variance like any other estimator.

The realm of "mere estimation" is where many Bayesian causal approaches appear in political science and other fields.
The estimation benefits of Bayes tend to fall into three categories: priors provide practical stabilization or regularization, posterior distributions are convenient quantifications of uncertainty, or MCMC provides a tractable way to fit a complex model.
We could characterize the use of Bayesian methods for these purposes as practically valuable but theoretically dispensable, in the sense that researchers might prefer non-Bayesian means to the same ends. 
For instance, @green-kern:2012:bart adapt Bayesian Additive Regression Trees [or BART, @chipman-et-al:2010:BART] to measure treatment effect heterogeneity in randomized experiments. [See @hill:2011:bart for a non-political science introduction to causal inference with BART.]
The advantages of a regression tree model for treatment heterogeneity is that it can explore arbitrary interactions among covariates while controlling overfitting, but the fact that BART is Bayesian isi an afterthought.
We observe a similar pattern in the use of Gaussian process models for fitting the running variable in regression discontinuity designs by @ornstein-duck-mayr:2020:GP-RDD and in the development of augmented LASSO estimators for sparse regression models by Ratkovic and Tingley [-@ratkovic-tingley:2017-direct-estimation, -@ratkovic-tingley:2017:sparse-lasso-plus].^[
  See @tibshirani:1996:lasso for a general introduction to the LASSO shrinkage estimator using the L1 penalized optimization.
  @park-casella:2008:bayesian-lasso implement a Bayesian LASSO using Laplace priors for regression coefficients.
]
These authors use priors to regularize richly parameterized functions, posterior distributions to characterize uncertainty, and MCMC to estimate models, but the theoretical implications of Bayesian causal estimation are not a major focus.

What does it mean for Bayesian estimation to have theoretical implications for causal inference? 
This brings our focus to level one of the causal inference hierarchy: the model of potential outcomes
Any estimation method that invokes Bayesian tools requires priors for model parameters. 
Because causal estimates are functions of model parameters, prior densities on model parameters imply that some causal effects can be more or less likely even before considering any data.
If the statistical model contains a unit-level data model, which is the case for most regression approaches, this implies that unit-level potential outcomes also have prior probability densities: some potential outcomes at the unit level are more or less likely, marginal of any observed data.
This is a decisive philosophical departure from a non-Bayesian approach to causal modeling, where potential outcomes and causal effects are simply defined in a space of outcomes.
<!------- TO DO ---------
- what's the correct term for this space?
------------------------->
As with causal effects, the benefit of prior distributions for unit outcomes is that that we can obtain, describe, and conduct direct inference using the posterior distribution for unit counterfactuals.
The drawback is that researchers must specify priors for model parameters and understand how they impact the implied priors for unit counterfactuals.
A few recent methodology papers in political science have invoked this idea of unit counterfactual estimation in a Bayesian framework, which is especially intuitive for synthetic control estimation [@carlson:2020:GP-synth; see @ratkovic-tingley:2017-direct-estimation for a regression application].
But these papers do not highlight the notion of direct priors for counterfactuals, so skeptical applied researchers have little guidance for understanding what it means to have priors on counterfactual data, either theoretically or practically.

The theoretical notion of prior densities in the potential outcome space is only interesting if it makes sense to see priors as important for causal estimation.
I have already argued that priors enable direct probabilistic inference on causal effects and unit counterfactuals, which is the essential modeling goal for causal inference in the first place.
It is natural to ask if it is sensible to use flat or uninformative priors achieve to enable direct probabilistic inference while minimizing the uncomfortable feeling of specifying priors for unobservable counterfactuals, avoiding the need to think hard about priors at all.
As I discuss in future sections, however, flat priors obscure rather than avoid these complexities.
This is because even simple modeling scenarios that begin with flat priors usually contain quantities of interest whose priors cannot also be flat.
As a result, it is the researcher's job to decide how to parameterize a problem and how the chosen priors affect the important quantities in the analysis.

Priors on important modeling constructs do not have to be an inconvenience.
There are many scenarios where priors can actually relax assumptions, building robustness checks directly into a statistical model.
This is layer two of the hierarchy, identification assumptions.
Many identification assumptions can be encoded as functional form assumptions in an estimated model.
Consider a regression scenario with outcome $Y_{i}$, treatment $A_{i}$, and some other covariate $U_{i}$.
\begin{align}
  \begin{split}
    \text{True model:} & Y_{i} &= \alpha + \tau A_{i} + \beta U_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
    \text{Estimated model:} & Y_{i} &= \hat{\alpha} + \hat{\tau} A_{i} + e_{i}
  \end{split}
(\#eq:omitted-confounder)
\end{align}
If we invoke an identifying assumption that the assignment of $A_{i}$ is ignorable, then our estimate for the average effect of $A_{i}$ using the second line of \@ref(eq:omitted-confounder) is unbiased.
This is equivalent to an assumption that the correlation between the treatment $A_{i}$ and the true error term $\epsilon_{i}$ is exactly zero.
For causal inference purposes, researchers have developed sensitivity tests that recover the treatment effect under ignorability violations, which work by picking a non-zero error correlation value and deriving the treatment under that model [@imai-et-al:2011:black-mox-mediation; @acharya-blackwell-sen:2016:direct-effects].


Researchers have derived estimators for $\tau$ in the presence of a, which can be used in a causal inference context to test the "robustness" or "sensitivity" of inferences to the ignorability assumption [@imai-et-al:2011:black-mox-mediation; @acharya-blackwell-sen:2016:direct-effects].
If this correlation is zero, the treatment effect estimate is unbiased
These are 

In a causal inference context, researchers sometimes develop sensitivity tests to test the robustness of their inference to violations of ignorability assumptions [@imai-et-al:2011:black-mox-mediation; @acharya-blackwell-sen:2016:direct-effects], exclusion restrictions [@nyhan-skovron-titiunik:2017:reg-bias], and so on.
Because identification assumptions are special cases of these more general models with additional nuisance parameters, it would be straightforward in a Bayesian framework to specify prior distributions on nuisance parameters that represent priors for violated assumptions. 
Unpublished work by @leavitt:2020:bayes-did explores this approach in a difference-in-difference contexts, introducing an "epistemic" source of variance in his treatment effect estimate by specifying a prior on the parallel trends assumption.

The Bayesian causal model began as an estimator for the an observable estimand, so it belonged to level 3 in the hierarchy.
As an estimation approach, it doesn't obviously change the observable estimand or the causal estimand.
Instead, it is an estimator that can be evaluated for its bias and variance like any other estimator. 


The model contained a data model conditional on parameters, and a parameter model 

What was I trying to say here? 

A causal parameter is a feature of the _causal model_. 

- The causal model is the model if you knew everything (level 1). 
- Individual causal effect is only a transformation of _data_. if I knew all potential outcomes, I could calculate this with only data.
- Estimands are different forms of causal effects, individual or aggregate.
- Assumptions let us state the conditions under which an individual or aggregate parameter can be estimated from observed data only (level 2).

Estimands are framed in terms of individual effects or aggregate expectations.

- The estimator (3) of an expectation or a counterfactual is thus a different thing from the hypothetical estimand.
- Some causal models imply nonparametric estimators, so no Bayesian anything will be required. However, estimates themselves are in-sample quantities, and any generalization about the in-sample effect can be augmented with priors.
- Bayes is an _estimation_ framework that doesn't change the causal model itself. It is a different way of estimating the quantities in an in-sample causal estimand.
- Oganisian and Roy (2020) "identification" assumptions vs. "statistical" assumptions. Identification assumptions get you to a place where you can express causal effects in terms of expectations about $Y$ given treatment, within confounding strata (perhaps then averaging over confounders). "Statistical" assumptions define how we think we can build $E[Y]$

Bayes is 
- Bayesian inference _begins_ as technology for thinking about statistical assumptions.
- It eventually becomes technology for experimenting with identification assumptions.


- For nonparametric estimators, structural priors can be helpful for concentrating probability mass in sensible areas of space, since nonparametric estimators may be lower-powered than estimators that get a power boost from parametric assumptions.
- Parametric models, in term, are obvious areas where Bayesian estimates can go, but they are stacking more assumptions on top of the parametric assumptions.
- Semi-parametric models are an interesting middle ground, where we want to be flexible about the exact nature of the underlying relationships, but we want to impose some stabilization to prevent the model from behaving like crazy.






Do battle with the "implied nonparametric estimator" framework.

- Causal models are manipulated to express causal _estimands_.
- the "nonparametric estimators" are usually just averages of treatment and control group outcomes, under ignorability assumptions.
- Parametric models for estimands are usually a byproduct of thinking within an MLE/regression framework. Many causal inf techniques do not do that. Instead they try to simply predict E[y(1) - y(0)] and do not care about the interpretability of the other RHS terms.
- Thinking outside the "typical econometric" framework it's actually kinda easy to see how one flavor of fitting Bayesian models for causal effects. If the technology for prediction is Bayesian, you just get the prediction and the posterior distribution. You then deal with the bias/variance properties of $\hat{y}$ or $\tilde{y}$ (unobserved counterfactuals) but at least your focus is on the predictions rather than coefficients (which, from this view, who cares about those?)
- This actually fits quite nicely with the machine learning approach to causal inference



We can think bigger about Bayesian _inference_ for a parameter as distinct from Bayesian _estimation_ of the in-sample quantity. 
This lets us use a nonparametric data-driven estimator for the data, but the "inference" or "generalization" still has a prior.
For instance a sample mean estimates a population mean without a likelihood model for the data, but inference about the population mean often follows a parametric assumption from the Central Limit Theorem that the sampling distribution from the mean is asymptotically normal (but doesn't have to, c.f. bootstrapping).
<!------- TO DO ---------
- Read more about sharp null and an RI framework for inference, 
  since this runs up against the idea of asymptotic normality of the means.
------------------------->
Even if the point estimator we use for a mean is unbiased, we can assimilate external information during the interpretation of the estimator (biasing the inference without biasing the point estimator).
Restated: the posterior distribution is a weighted average of the raw point estimator and external information, rather than biasing the data-driven estimate directly.

Even bigger: Bayesian inference about _models_ (Baldi and Shahbaba 2019). 
This is probably where I have to start my justification for this? 
The _entire point_ of causal inference is to make inferences about counterfactuals given data (Rubin 1978?).
Invoking Bayesian inference is really the only way to say what we _want_ to say about causal effects: what are the plausible causal effects given the model/data. We do _not_ care about the plausibility of data given the null (as a primary QOI). 
- Probably want to use Harrell-esque language? Draw on intuition from clinical research, or even industry. We want our best answer, not a philosophically indirect weird jumble.
- This probably also plays into the Cox/Jeffreys/Jaynes stuff I have open on my computer.

### Inferential Goals {#sec:why-bcm}

1. posterior isn't about frequency properties
2. 



What is "bias?"

- look up in BDA
- "Requiring unbiased estimates will often lead to relevant information being ignored (as we discuss with hierarchical models in Chapter 5)" (94)


Why would we want this? Inference makes more sense.

- What's the probability of a model/hypothesis, given the data
- vs. What's the probability of "more extreme data" (?) given a model that I do not believe.
- posterior probabilities mean what they say they mean
    - conditioning on data (and implicitly the model), this is the distribution of parameters
    - p-values are the "probability of more extreme results." They condition on the model, but they're only useful if they do not.

Proper frequentist analysis is violated as soon as you look at the data.

Are we in a repeated sampling framework at all?

Frequency properties are still possible for Bayesian estimators, but we view frequency properties as a byproduct of something more essential (MSE).



### Shared Goals, Different Tactics

Fux with GGK:

- measure = truth + bias + variance
- causal inference: 
    - reduce bias "by design" 
    - shrink prior on bias
- bayesian estimation:
    - shrink prior on variance using prior info
    - or shrink prior on measure, where truth = measure - bias - variance


Not _inherently_ the same as "agnostic" inference though we fux with both.



## Making Sense of Priors in Causal Inference {#sec:causal-priors}


This is because a prior's flatness is only relative to the parameterization of a model, and functions of parameters are not likely to have flat densities even if the underlying parameters have flat densities


### Priors as Data Falsification

<!------- TO DO ---------
- figure this out
DATA FALSIFICATION digression
------------------------->

Data falsification versus unavoidable choice:
imagine a study with a posterior distribution $p(\mu \mid \mathbf{y})$ that is proportional to the likelihood times the prior. 
  \begin{align}
    (\#eq:propto)
    p(\mu \mid \mathbf{y}) &\propto p(\mathbf{y} \mid \mu)p(\mu)
  \end{align}
Rewrite the right side in product notation for $n$ observations of $y_{i}$ for units indexed by $i$, letting $l(y_{i}) = p(y_{i} \mid \mu)$
  \begin{align}
    p(\mu \mid \mathbf{y}) &\propto \prod\limits_{i = 1}^{n}l(y_{i})p(\mu)
    (\#eq:propto-index)
  \end{align}
Suppose that we express this proportionality on the log scale, where the log posterior is proportional to the log likelihood plus the log posterior.
  \begin{align}
    \begin{split}
      \log p(\mu \mid \mathbf{y}) 
        &\propto \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \log l(y_{i}) 
          + \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \log p(\mu) \\[12pt]
        &\propto \log l(y_{1}) + \log p(\mu)
                 + \log l(y_{2}) + \log p(\mu)
                 + \ldots
                 + \log l(y_{n}) + \log p(\mu)
    \end{split}
  (\#eq:log-propto-index)
  \end{align}


The setup in \@ref(eq:log-propto-index) highlights a few appealing intuitions.
First, it shows how each observation "adds information" to the log posterior distribution.
Data that are more likely to be observed given the parameter (larger $l(y_{i})$ values) increase the posterior probability that parameter. 
We also see that the prior probability "adds information" to the posterior in the same way data add information, captured by the addition of each $p(\mu)$ term. 
Parameters that are more probable in the prior are more probable in the posterior.

The proportionality \@ref(eq:log-propto-index) also reveals how the posterior "learns" from flat priors.
A flat priors implies that prior probability $p(\mu)$ is constant for all potential values of $\mu$.
Because \@ref(eq:log-propto-index) is a proportionality, this lets us disregard $p(\mu)$ entirely by factoring it out of the proportionality, leaving us with an expression that the log posterior is proportional to the likelihood of the data only if the prior is flat.
\begin{align}
  \log p(\mu \mid \mathbf{y}) 
        &\propto
        \log l(y_{1}) + \log l(y_{2}) + \ldots + \log l(y_{n})
  (\#eq:log-propto-flat)
\end{align}
If $p(\mu)$ is not flat, however, and $p(\mu)$ varies across values of $\mu$, we can no longer ignore $p(\mu)$ in \@ref(eq:log-propto-index) shows that $p(\mu)$ varies across values $\mu$.
Not only does this prevent us from dropping $p(\mu)$ from the proportionality, but it also reveals how the prior "adds information" to the posterior by the same mechanism that observations do: adding to the log posterior distribution. 
This general expression where both data and priors contribute to the posterior distribution has led some researchers to argue the Bayesian inference with non-flat priors is analytically indistinguishable from data falsification [@garcia-perez:2019:bayes-data-falsification].
We can highlight this behavior by obscuring each $p(\mu)$ term with a square $\square$.
\begin{align}
  \log p(\mu \mid \mathbf{y}) 
        &\propto
        \log l(y_{1}) + \square + \log l(y_{2}) + \square \ldots + \log l(y_{n}) + \square
  (\#eq:log-propto-falsification)
\end{align}
Behind each square is _some contribution_ to the log posterior.
The fact that it adds information to the log posterior is unaffected by whether the hidden term is the probability of an additional observation $l(y_{i})$ or the prior probability of a parameter value $p(\mu)$.

- "flat" isn't non-informative. They are just non-informative _relative to_ the likelihood. A likelihood that identifies a narrower region of parameter space will more quickly overcome a flatter prior, but it isn't the same as "non-informative." The speed with which a likelihood targets parameter space is a feature of the likelihood.

The primary resistance to Bayesian inference in applied research is the need to set a prior at all. To many researchers, the prior distribution is an additional assumptions that is never feels justified because it is external to the data. Often researchers wish to sidestep this choice altogether, preferring a "flat" prior that prefers all parameters equally.

We have seen so far that the parameterization of a model has consequences for prior specification. Reparameterization may result in an algebraically equivalent likelihood

- define "equivalent reparameterization"
------------------------->


The incoherence of flatness: 

- no universally valid strategy for specifying flat priors because it is always possible to rearrange the data model either by transforming a parameter or otherwise rearranging the likelihood. 

Consider an experiment with a binary treatment $Z$ and a binary outcome variable $Y$. We want to determine the effect of $Z$ by comparing the success probability in the treatment group, $\pi_{1}$, to the success probability in the control group, $\pi_{0}$.



- "no way to conceptualize an uninformative prior because you can always rearrange the problem through a reparameterization or transformation of a parameter"
- examples of transformations having crazy implications/MLE being wild (logit).
- Jeffreys prior: actually a very limited range of priors that satisfy an "invariance" property. My words: such that the "amount of information obtained from data about is invariant to parameterization of the likelihood, for all possible values of the parameter," or, "the only way for the posterior distribution to be exactly the same, given the same data, for all true parameter values (?), is the Jeffreys prior," or, regardless of the data, I will learn the same thing about the generative model regardless of which equivalent parameterization of the generative model is used.  
    - is it worth it to think about the theoretical meaning of information
    - how does flatness reflect information in nonlinear scales?


Suppose we have some posterior distribution which relies on some parameter vector $\overrightarrow{\alpha}$. 
\begin{align}
  p\left(\overrightarrow{\alpha} \mid y\right) &\propto 
    p(y \mid \overrightarrow{\alpha} )
    p( \overrightarrow{\alpha} )
\end{align}
Consider some alternate parameterization of the likelihood parameterized by $\overrightarrow{\beta}$. 

Nonlinear transformation of $\pi$ does not preserve a uniform density over parameters.





Alex meeting takeaways:

- every prior has a "covariant" prior in a different parameterization
- the posteriors will be covariant as well.
- The way you get between them is by transforming the parameter and doing the appropriate Jacobian transformation to the density.
- Jeffrey's priors are a special case of this where the prior is proportional to the determinant of the information matrix. This has the beneficial property of "optimal learning" from the data. For example, flat Beta prior doesn't "hedge toward 50" in quite the same way.


### Priors and Model Parameterization {sec:prior-parameterization}

Priors are defined with respect to a model of the data (the likelihood). 
<!------- TO DO ---------
- discuss Betancourt, Simpson, Gelman
------------------------->
We may have priors about the way the world works, but we rarely have priors about model parameters. This is because parameters are an invention in the model. They are mathematical abstractions similar to points and lines, so they only exist when we translate the world into a mathematical language. This means that the mathematical representation of the world is in direct dialog with the choices available to a researcher about how to encode prior information. In the real world, the prior information that I have about the world isn't affected by a mathematical representation of the world. As a researcher, the way I encode prior information depends on the choices I make about that mathematical representation.

One essential feature for understanding prior choices in practice is the _parameterization_ of the data model, $p(y \mid \phi)$, for some generic parameter $\phi$.^[
  Bayesian practitioners sometimes refer to the data model as the "likelihood." 
  This can be confusing because the "likelihood function" more traditionally refers to the _product_ of the data probabilities under the data model.
  References to the "parameterization of the likelihood" should be understood as interchangeable with "parameterization of the data model," since the former is determined entirely by the latter. 
]
We say that a data model has an "equivalent reparameterization" if for some transformed parameter $\psi = f(\phi)$, the function that defines the data model can be rewritten in terms of $\psi$ and return an equivalent likelihood of the data. More formally, the parameterization is equivalent if $p(y \mid \phi) = p(y \mid \psi)$ for all possible $y$.

In a maximum likelihood framework, equivalent parameterizations are a more benign feature of the modeling framework. Reparameterization may result in likelihood surfaces that have easier geometries for optimization algorithms to explore, but the _value_ of the likelihood function is unaffected by the algebraic definition or parameterization of the likelihood function. For instance, a Normally distributed variable $x$ with mean $\mu$ could be parameterized in terms of standard deviation $\sigma$ or in terms of precision $\tau = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}$, but the resulting density is unaffected.
\begin{align}
  \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\left(\frac{x - \mu}{2\sigma}\right)^{2}}
  &=
  \sqrt{\frac{\tau}{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{\tau\left(x - \mu\right)^{2}}{2}}
  (\#eq:normal-sigma-equal-tau)
\end{align}
The consequence for Bayesian analysis, however, is that the parameterization of the data model determines the set of parameters and their functional relationship to the data.


<!------- TO DO ---------
- linear reparameterization: easy to understand
- decide if non-centering is worth it to discuss here
- nonlinear reparameterization: a much bigger problem
------------------------->



One example of equivalent reparameterization arises with the different possible ways to write a linear regression model. 
The first form specifies $y_{i}$ for unit $i$ as a linear function of $x_{i}$ with a random error that is mean $0$ and standard deviation $\sigma$.
\begin{align}
  (\#eq:ols-noncenter)
  y_{i} &= \alpha + \beta x_{i} + \varepsilon_{i}, & \text{where } \varepsilon_{i} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}\left(0, \sigma \right)
\end{align}
The second form, more common when viewing linear regression in the framework of generalized linear models, is to express $y_{i}$ directly as the random variable, with a conditional mean defined by the regression function and standard deviation $\sigma$.
\begin{align}
  (\#eq:ols-center)
  y_{i} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}\left( \alpha + \beta x_{i},\sigma\right)
\end{align}
Algebraically, these two models are identical.
The difference is only a matter of which component has the distributional assumption.
In Equation \@ref(eq:ols-noncenter), the distribution is assigned to $\varepsilon_{i}$, so $y_{i}$ is a random variable only by way of $\varepsilon_{i}$.
In Equation \@ref(eq:ols-center), we assign the distributional assumption directly to $y_{i}$, bringing the regression function into the mean rather than "factoring it out" of the distribution.

```{r normal-factoring}
normal_n <- 500
normal_mu <- 4
normal_sd <- 2
```

```{r plot-normal-factoring, include = TRUE, fig.cap = "Demonstration of centered and non-centered parameterizations for a Normal distribution. The non-centered parameterization is statistically equivalent, but the location and scale are factored out of the distribution."}
set.seed(0987)
tibble(
  y1 = rnorm(n = normal_n, mean = normal_mu, sd = normal_sd),
  y2 = normal_mu + normal_sd * rnorm(n = normal_n, mean = 0, sd = 1)
) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything()) %>%
  ggplot() +
  aes(x = value, color = name) +
  stat_ecdf(size = 1) +
  coord_cartesian(
    xlim = c(normal_mu - 2 * normal_sd, normal_mu + 2 * normal_sd)
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = seq(-10, 10, normal_sd)
  ) +
  labs(
    title = str_glue(
      "Empirical CDF of Normal({normal_mu}, {normal_sd}) Samples"
    ),
    subtitle = str_glue(
      "{normal_n} Draws from Centered and Non-Centered Distributions"
    ),
    x = TeX("Random Variable $\\nu$"),
    y = "ECDF"
  ) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c(med2, dark2)) +
  theme(legend.position = "none")
```

The linear regression context is one context where the choice of parameterization appears. These two parameterizations are typically called the "centered" and "non-centered" parameterization for a Normal distribution. In the centered parameterization, the random variable is drawn from a distribution "centered" on a systematic component, whereas the non-centered distribution factors out any location and scale information from the distribution, such that the only remaining random variable is a standardized variate. The equations below describe a Normal variable $\nu$ with mean $`r normal_mu`$ and standard deviation $`r normal_sd`$.
\begin{align}
  \text{Centered Parameterization:} && \nu &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(`r normal_mu`, `r normal_sd`) \\
  \text{Non-Centered Parameterization:} && \nu &= `r normal_mu` + `r normal_sd`z, & \text{where } z &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(0, 1)
\end{align}
To demonstrate that these parameterizations are equivalent, I simulate $`r normal_n`$ simulations from each parameterization and plot their empirical cumulative distribution functions alongside each other in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-normal-factoring). Because the distributions are the same, the empirical CDFs are identical except for random sampling error.

Problems of beliefs:

- No degree of belief.
- Parameterization makes this too challenging.
- Prior might change depending on what I ate for lunch. 
- "Elicitation" of priors satisfying the wrong audience, or at the very least can be easily misused. We do not want to elicit priors about arcane model parameters. We want to elicit priors about the _world_ (Gill Walker)d


Problems of nuisance prior

- parameterization gets you again
- the MLEs are unstable, overfit
- make the regularization argument in-sample




Pragmatic view of priors

- we're between full information and nuisance prior
- Weak information: structure, regularization, identification
- Structural information about parameters
- regularization toward zero (L1, L2), learning by pooling
- stabilizing weakly identified parameters, separation, etc.


Parameters are a _choice_. 

- They are part of the _rhetoric_ of a model. Sometimes we make pragmatic choices (something is easy to give an independent prior to, but independence isn't always valuable per se). Sometimes we make principled choices (normality, laplace, etc). 
- They deserve scrutiny (else just "excrete your posterior") and are a part of the model that you should check and diagnose. 
- They aren't merely a nuisance because we can use them to our benefit, 
- sometimes when we parameterize a problem to reveal easier things to place convenient priors on
<!------- TO DO ---------
- Gelman "Parameterization" paper: parameterization for convenience often reveals a new family of models. For Bayesian inference, it reveals a new family of priors. For _causal_ inference, we should pay careful attention to the way parameterization bears on the priors that we do and do not feel comfortable using, and the way that parameterization presents opportunities to improve on other work.

### Balancing Pragmatic and Principled Approaches to Priors {#sec:bayes-how-to}



Various roles that priors take on

- merely facilitate posterior inference
- structural information
- weak information
- regularization / stabilization
- prior knowledge

A general orientation toward priors in this dissertation:

- Not about "stacking the deck" or hazy notions of "prior beliefs"
- information, not belief
- Bayesian view of probability is _more general_, contains information and beliefs. Information is priors, but it's also data. Information is the fundamental unit of uncertainty-quantification
- inference about the thing we care about (counterfactuals)
- structural information when we have it
- Causal inference: "agnosticism" is something valuable generally

Priors are not de-confounders

- downweighting, not upweighting



### Generalization, Big and Small




Models (likelihoods) are priors

- we restrict the space of all other models
- could think about "flexible" models, but these are just priors over more spaces

Identification assumptions are priors

Generalization to any population is a prior

- priors are not MY data, but ANY data
- parameters describe ANY data
- Lampinen Vehtari 2001: likelihood as "prior for the data" is the basis for all generalization from any finite model
<!-- Describing the prior information explicitly distinguishes the Bayesian approach from the maximum likelihood (ML) methods. It is important to notice, however, that the role of prior knowledge is equally important in any other approach, including the ML. Basically, all generalization is based on the prior knowledge, as discussed in Lemm (1996, 1999); the training samples provide information only at those points, and the prior knowledge provides the necessary link between the training samples and the not yet measured future samples.  -->

We are always doing violence, but the framework lets us build out more and more general models to structure our uncertainties

Email to David:

> My first reaction to this is like this: it's probably correct to say that Bayesians may have some shared ideas about how to think about generalizing that might differ systematically from non-Bayesians, but I am not sure how much of that is because of Bayes per se so much as just...the types of modeling someone is willing to do. By "modeling" I mean, functional form assumptions are you willing to make about data, which is different from "Bayes" in that the former is something required of all modeling and the latter is only what you can say about parameters. For example, a functional modeling thing you might do is specify (using some weights or something) how an estimate in one sample might map to another sample, but whether you do that with Bayesian estimation is a separate choice aside from the functional model itself. That being said, even though functional modeling things can be done with Bayes/non-Bayes point of view, it does seem right to say that certain modeling approaches may feel more natural in a Bayesian framework, or that Bayesians might construe a problem slightly differently because they are more used to hierarchical modeling. 
> 
> That's a pragmatic view of things, but I can give you a more theoretically abstract view, and think of situations where Bayesian lets you do things that non-Bayes can't. It all comes down to how "seriously" you want to take the tenets of Bayesian work and what kind of generalization-based claims you want to make. So I will lay out a series of vignettes that start from a world where Bayes is "not unique" and then gets into worlds where Bayes gets more and more necessary to say what you want to say about the out-of-sample world. I will use the example of estimating some parameter, but you can translate this into learning about a "mechanism" however Erica and Nick are defining that, and you can think about it non-statistically as well even if I'll use statistical modeling language.
> 
> I estimate some parameter $\mu$ in a study, but it's one instance of a more general phenomenon. If the study were representative of the world, you can imagine that the effect is one instance of the "population effect" and give it a hierarchical prior as such: $\mu \sim D(\theta, \sigma)$ where D() is some distribution, $\theta$ is the "general" effect. If I learn about $\mu$ (the estimate and standard error $\sigma$), I learn about $\theta$! Choice of distribution depends on your assumptions about the stochastic process at work. naturally, but that logic works basically just like a likelihood function choice. (In fact, Bayes sees priors for parameters as mechanistically no different from likelihoods for data. Which is to say, MLE models like logit are simply hierarchical priors on the data, and regression is estimating the hierarchical parameters of the prior.) This is basically a meta-analysis setup using Bayesian language: if you want tangible examples you can look at the Don Rubin "eight schools experiment" which is about generalizing from parallel studies in schools, or Rachael Meager (sp) has a paper applying this setup to micro-credit experiments in the development econ context: what do we learn about the "overall effect of microcredit expansion" by assimilating information from different studies. In this sense the priors are just ways to structure the meta-analysis.
> 
> If the study is unrepresentative or "not externally valid" then it's up to the researcher to specify some approach to modeling the invalidity: $\theta \sim D(f(\theta), \sigma)$, where f() is some function that distorts the representativeness of the study. Which is to say, $f(\theta)$ is the expectation for a study with these distortions. Researcher's task is then to learn the form of f(). These distortions might be like sample bias, the country where the study was performed, or whatever, and all you're really doing is reweighting or adjusting the estimate to make more sense for the target population. If you can estimate parameters that determine f(), viola you can infer the posterior distribution for the true $\theta$. But this is what I mean when I say that none of this is really EXCLUSIVELY Bayesian. Reweighting/adjusting happens in non-Bayes world all the time; the main thing that is different is how you write the model and your ability to say that the population estimate is a "posterior of the true parameter, given the information learned from the data." One example of this kind of thing is maybe the multilevel regression and poststratification: we use national surveys to model the attitudes of different demographic groups, and then we use those model predictions plus census information to project estimates for smaller units, for example states or counties, based on the demographic composition of those units! This example goes the other direction from where Erica and Nick want to go (from representative to unrepresentative) but the technology sounds similar: estimate something in the data that you have, and map it into a space where you do not have data. MRP in political science comes from Bayes world and feels natural there, but nothing saying that it HAS to be Bayesian in its overall approach.
> 
> Now we get to a world where Bayes is more necessary. If there's something TRULY Bayesian that really makes no sense withoutBayes, it is the fact that I actually do not need data about f() in order to estimate $\theta$. This is because I have priors even in the absence of data. If all I have is priors about f(), then even if I collect data about ONLY $\mu$ and NOTHING about f(), I nonetheless update my information about $\theta$. This is because the parameters are functionally related through f(), so if I learn about the subsample then I learn about the population. Stated differently, learning about $\mu$ restricts the space of $\theta$ because I can basically "solve backward" using my priors about f. This is the stuff that is very natural in Bayes, and I can think of basically no analog in non-Bayes that lets you do something similar (other than picking point estimates for unknowns and simulating, which doesn't have the same theoretical coherence as a prior/posterior distribution). Of course, this means that inference on f() is subject to the priors that go into f(), which is exactly the kind of thing that non-Bayesians are super afraid of despite majorly misconstruing how this works (IMO). For one, the functional form of f() is the kind of thing non-Bayesians would make assumptions about anyway, so that's not unique to Bayes at all. And secondly, the priors that would go into f() would usually be generic enough that researchers aren't "picking their hypothesis" (a common and frankly stupid stereotype) so much as restricting the space of f() to rule out stuff that's frankly impossible. Happy to give you more concrete examples of the kind of "weakly informative priors" that someone would use in a situation like that if it's a route you want to dig into more. It's this kind of stuff that I think non-Bayesians are under-utilizing: how much extrapolation power you get by being willing to place even weak priors on stuff you can't exactly identify with data. And if you REALLY want to give a nod to Bayesian views of extrapolation, this is the area you'd want to dig into, because it's the stuff that doesn't really make sense without Bayes. You can sort of see Ken and I do this in our voter ID paper (which you can find on my website) though we kind of wimp out of fully placing priors on f().
> 
> Here's where things get really abstract because, gun to my head, we can be really scorched-earth and say that all extrapolation falls apart without a Bayesian notion of priors. Think about any model for data: $y \sim D(\theta)$, I think my data come from this distribution, and if I were to go out into the world and collect new data, my estimate for a new data point is characterized by this distribution assumption i.e. this prior for the data. If you try to lay out a formal definition of what "generalization" is, I would say that there is no such thing as generalization without an implicit prior that links your observed data to unobserved things that you want to project into. There are stats theorems out there called "no free lunch" theorems that basically say "all statistical inference is limiting the space of models that link parameters to data, and there is no way to improve your guess for a new data point using a model except to impose prior information on the system by way of the model." So this would be a hard line view of what priors mean in a philosophy of science (not necessarily quantitative or statistical, mind you), but that if you accept that view it trickles down into the more minor examples in a very natural way: the only way to generalize is by using priors to structure the connection between what I do observe and what I do not observe.

For instance, consider a simple experiment with a binary outcome variable $y_{i}$ and binary treatment assignment $z_{i} \in \{0, 1\}$. Suppose that the treatment effect of interest is a difference-in-means, $\bar{y}_{z = 1} - \bar{y}_{z = 0}$, estimated from a linear probability model. This linear probability model might be parameterized in two ways. First is a conventional regression setup,
\begin{align}
  y_{i} &= \alpha + \beta z_{i} + \epsilon_{i}
  (\#eq:diff-means-example)
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is the control group mean, $\alpha + \beta$ is the treatment group mean, $\beta$ represents the difference in means, and $\epsilon_{i}$ is a symmetric error term for unit $i$. With the model parameterized in this way, the researcher must specify priors for $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Suppose that the researcher gives $\beta$ a flat prior to represent ignorance about the treatment effect. An equivalent _likelihood model_ for the data would be to treat each observation as a function of its group mean $\mu_{z}$.
\begin{align}
  y_{i} &= z_{i}\mu_{1} + \left(1 - z_{i}\right)\mu_{0}  + \epsilon_{i}
  (\#eq:separate-means-example)
\end{align}
Although the treatment effect $\beta$ from Equation \@ref(eq:diff-means-example) is equivalent to the difference in means $\mu_{1} - \mu_{0}$ from Equation \@ref(eq:separate-means-example), the parameterization of the model affects the implied prior for the difference in means. If the researcher gives a flat prior to both $\mu_{\mathbf{z}}$ terms, the implied prior for the difference in means will not be flat. Instead, it will be triangular, as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-diff-means-example). The underlying mechanics of this problem are well-known in applied statistics---if we continue adding parameters, the Central Limit Theorem describes how the resulting distribution will converge to Normality---but it takes the explicit specification of priors to shine a light on the consequences of default prior choices in a particular case. In particular it shows how even flat priors, which are popularly regarded as "agnostic" priors because of their implicit connection to maximum likelihood estimators, do not necessarily imply flat priors about the researcher's key quantities of interest. Rather, flat priors can create a variety of unintended prior distributions that do not match the researcher's expectations. I return to this important idea in the discussion about setting priors for a probit model in Section \@ref(sec:probit-prior).

"The Bayesian approach also clarifies what can be learned in the noncompliance problem when causal estimands are intrinsically not fully “identified.” In par- ticular, issues of identification are quite different from those in the frequen- tist perspective because with proper prior distributions, posterior distribu- tions are always proper." (Imbens and Rubin 1997)

This is where Imbens and Rubin push (also Horiuchi et al. example)

Randomization limits the impact of the Bayesian assumptions 

- "Classical random- ized designs stand out as especially appealing assignment mechanisms designed to make inference for causal effects straightforward by limiting the sensitivity of a valid Bayesian analysis." (Rubin 1978)




## Bayesian Opportunities



### Full Posterior Uncertainty

Multi-stage models

- uncertain measures _are priors_
- propensity models (Zigler, Plummer/cutting, liao and zigler...)
- structural models
- to bootstrap or not to bootstrap?


Matching


Predictive/ML models

- ML approach to causal inference recasts the problem as a prediction problem for the treatment assignment.
- Treatment effects are then integrated over the uncertainty in the propensity
- This propagates uncertainty using the exact model machinery, rather than a post-hoc computational workaround like bootstrapping
    - Bootstrapping does have an appealing feature that it isn't making a parametric assumption about errors in the model. It simply uses the "sampling uncertainty" intuition to build intuitive bounds on effect uncertainty.
    - However in many real-world cases the data we have cannot be resampled, so the framework for inference under bootstrapping doesn't make theoretical sense without appealing to a "superpopulation" philosophy. 
    - Bayes naturally deals with this by assigning a probability distribution to the unmodeled features, which mechanistically follows a similar assumption as a parametric assumption about errors in any typical regression case: the prior isn't really extra. 
    - If this assumption isn't something you want, it is possible to generalize the model by specifying an overdispersion parameter and letting the data inform what which model estimates can be rationalized against plausible overdispersion parameters. For example, Kruske's BEST approach to difference-in-means testing. 
- In a Bayesian framework, we have posterior More of a "priors to facilitate posteriors" approach, not a prior information view (since there is some formal data peeking involved)

### Application: Weakly Informed Regression Discontinuity

This section presents a reanalysis of Hall's -@hall:2015:extremists regression discontinuity study of congressional elections.
Portions of the original analysis contain a pathological result where confidence intervals for key parameters of interest contain values that could not possibly occur with nonzero probability.
We overcome the pathology using weakly informative priors that contain structural information about the dependent variable only, excluding impossible parameters from the prior but uninformative over possible parameter values.
This minor prior intervention successfully guides the posterior distribution away from impossible regions of parameter space, resulting in a posterior distribution that is consistent with the data as well as external structural information about the problem.
This intervention does not undermine the main takeaway from the original study, but the Bayesian estimates for the effect of interest are notably smaller and more precisely estimated.

With similar aims to this project, @hall:2015:extremists examines primary elections and their impact on ideological representation in Congress.
The study asks if extremist candidates for Congress are more likely or less likely to win the general election contest than candidates who are relatively moderate by comparison.
The treatment variable of interest, the ideological extremity of a party's general election nominee, is confounded by several factors.
Competitive districts may lead more moderate candidates to run in the first place, creating selection biases for which candidates represent which district.
Conversely, voters in electorally "safe" districts may feel freer to nominate more extreme candidates because the likelihood of their party losing the seat in the general election is sufficiently low. 
Furthermore, the incumbency advantage in general elections confounds this picture if incumbents tend to be more moderate than challengers who are angling to raise their name recognition [@gelman-king:1990:incumbency]. 

To identify the effect of candidate ideology, @hall:2015:extremists leverages the vote margin in the primary election as a forcing variable in a regression discontinuity design (RDD).
In a primary contest between a relative extremist and a relative moderate, the extremist advances to the general election if their vote share in the primary is greater than the moderate's, i.e.\ the extremist's _margin_ (difference) over the moderate is any greater than $0$.
If the extremist's primary margin is any less than $0$, the moderate advances to the general election instead.
This primary margin deterministically assigns congressional candidacies to treatment or control if the extremist wins or loses the primary, respectively.
While candidate ideology's effect on general election outcomes may be confounded in the aggregate, the effect can be identified at the threshold (extremist margin of $0$).
The key identification assumption for a "sharp" regression discontinuity design is that the forcing variable, $X_{i}$, and the expected outcome given the forcing variable, $\E{Y_{i}(x) \mid X_{i}}$, are both continuous at the threshold $x_{0}$.
This assumption identifies _local_ treatment as the difference in the limits of the conditional expectations for treatment ($X = 1$) and control ($X = 0$) at the threshold [@skovron-titiunik:2015:practical-rdd; @calonico-et-al:2014:rdd-CIs].
\begin{align}
  \lim_{x \downarrow x_{0}} \E{Y_{i} \mid X_{i} = x} -
    \lim_{x \uparrow x_{0}} \E{Y_{i} \mid X_{i} = x}
  &= 
  \E{Y_{i}(1) - Y_{i}(0) \mid X_{i} = x_{0}}
  (\#eq:rdd-continuity)
\end{align}
Equation \@ref(eq:rdd-continuity) implies that the difference in potential outcomes can be identified from observed data only by observing that everything else about units is continuous at the threshold except for the realized treatment value.

@hall:2015:extremists applies the RD design by assuming that the effect of candidate ideology on vote share and win probability in the general election are identified locally where the extremist's margin in the primary election crosses $0$.
For this example, we concentrate on models that predict win probability, since these are the estimates that contain pathological results that we can avoid with Bayesian methods.
Hall estimates RD models using a few different specifications, but I replicate his simplest design, which is a linear probability model (LPM) of the following form.
The local linear regression is justified by the limit intuition of the key assumption in \@ref(eq:rdd-continuity); any nonlinear regression function, as long as it is continuous at the cutoff, converges to linearity at the cutoff in the limit.
Data were obtained from Hall's replication materials, available on his website.^[
  <http://www.andrewbenjaminhall.com/>, last accessed July 02, 2020.
]
The outcome $y_{dpt}$ is a binary indicator that takes the value $1$ if the general candidate running in district $d$ for party $p$ in election year $t$ wins the general election, and it takes $0$ if the candidate loses the general election,
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  y_{dpt} 
  &= 
  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}(\text{Extremist Wins Primary})_{dpt} + 
    \beta_{2}(\text{Extremist Primary Margin})_{dpt} \\
    &\quad + \beta_{3}(\text{Extremist Wins Primary} \times \text{Extremist Primary Margin})_{dpt} + \epsilon_{dpt}
\end{split}
(\#eq:hall-rd)
\end{align}
where _Extremist Primary Margin_ is the extremist candidate's margin over the moderate candidate with the highest vote in the primary, and _Extremist Wins Primary_ is a binary indicator equaling $1$ if that margin exceeds $0$, and $\epsilon_{dpt}$ is an error term. 
When the extremist margin exceeds $0$, the candidate representing case $dpt$ is the extremist, otherwise the candidate representing $dpt$ is the moderate.
The coefficient $\beta_{1}$ represents the intercept shift associated with the extremist primary win, estimating the treatment effect of candidate extremism  at the discontinuity.
I replicate this LPM using ordinary least squares, and I also create a Bayesian equivalent using an algebraically reparameterization.
The Bayesian parameterization has the same linear form, but instead of specifying two lines an interaction term, I subscript the coefficients by $w$, which indexes the treatment status (_Extremist Wins Primary_),
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  y_{dpt} &= \alpha_{w[dpt]} + \beta_{w[dpt]}(\text{Extremist Primary Margin})_{dpt} + \epsilon_{dpt} \\
  \epsilon_{dpt} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}\left( 0, \sigma \right)
\end{split}
(\#eq:bayes-rd)
\end{align}
where $\alpha_{w}$ is an intercept for treatment status $w$, and $\beta_{w}$ is the slope for treatment $w$.
This parameterization implies two lines, one line for $w = 0$ and another line for $w = 1$.
The treatment effect at the discontinuity is the difference between the intercepts, $\alpha_{1} - \alpha_{0}$.
This parameterization will be helpful for extending the model below.

I plot the OLS win probability estimates around the discontinuity in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-rd).
At the discontinuity, we estimate that extremism decreases a candidate's win probability by `r coef(ols_lmfit)["treat"] %>% abs() %>% round(2)` percentage points, which is the same effect found by @hall:2015:extremists.
The original publication lacks a graphical depiction of these results.
Our visualization of the RD predictions reveal that the confidence set for the parameter estimates that compose the treatment effect contain many values that would be impossible to observe.
The point estimate for average moderate candidate win probability at the discontinuity is `r coef(ols_lmfit)["(Intercept)"] %>% round(2)`, which is a possible number to obtain, but the 95 percent confidence intervals includes values as high as `r confint(ols_lmfit)["(Intercept)", "97.5 %"] %>% round(2)`, which far exceeds the maximum possible value of $1.0$.

```{r plot-rd, include = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 6, fig.cap = "OLS estimates of the predicted probability that a candidate wins the general election. Local average treatment effect is estimated at the threshold. Treatment effect is defined by parameter estimates whose confidence sets contain values with no possibility of being true."}
```

This pathology is possible in any LPM with finite data, but there are a few pragmatic reasons why we might not worry about it.
First, for fully saturated model specifications, predicated probabilities from a model LPM are unbiased estimates of the true probabilities, and thus are an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect of interest.
<!------- TO DO ---------
- cite
------------------------->
For frequentist inference, constructing a 95 percent confidence interval on this unbiased estimate might be enough to suit the researcher's needs.
In this particular case, however, these reasons may not satisfy our goals.
First, the model isn't fully saturated.
Because the design employs a local linear regression, the extrapolation of the regression function to the threshold is model-dependent [@calonico-et-al:2014:rdd-CIs].
It makes sense, then, to build a model that constrains those extrapolations only to regions of parameter space that are mathematically possible for the problem at hand. 
Furthermore, the repeated sampling intuition of the frequentist approach does not guide our inferences because the data in the analysis are the population of interest.
We have no ability to repeatedly sample this data generating process, so our uncertainty about our inferences must come from some other mechanism.
Most importantly, because the intercept estimates are essential for defining the treatment effect of interest, the degree to which this one estimate is corrupted presents a significant problem for the inferences we can draw from the analysis.

To visualize just how much posterior probability this model places in impossible regions of parameter space, Figure \@ref(fig:plot-flat-effect) shows a histogram of posterior samples for the treatment effect from the Bayesian version of this model using (improper) flat priors on all parameters.
Because flat priors do nothing to concentrate prior probability density away from pathological regions of parameter space, a large proportion of posterior samples contain intercept estimates that do not and cannot represent win probabilities.
Of the `r (parallel::detectCores() * (rd_iter - rd_warmup)) %>% scales::comma()` posterior samples considered by this model fit, `r 
  const_draws %>%
  filter(.variable == "Non-Extremist Intercept") %$% 
  mean(invalid, na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  scales::percent(accuracy = 1)
`
of the non-extremist intercepts are "impossible" to obtain because they are greater than $1$ or less than $0$.
A small number of MCMC samples for the extremist intercepts take impossible values as well. 
As a result, just `r effect_draws %$% mean(invalid == FALSE) %>% scales::percent(accuracy = 1)` of MCMC samples for the treatment effect is composed of parameters that are mathematically possible.
Even invoking the practical benefits of the LPM, such a high level of corruption in the most important quantity of this analysis is cause to rethink the approach.

```{r plot-flat-effect, include = TRUE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, fig.cap = 'Histogram of posterior samples for the treatment effect. Using flat priors for each win probability intercept, a substantial share of the treatment distribution consists of parameters that cannot possibly occur.'}
```

The Bayesian approach begins with structural prior information about the intercepts estimated at the discontinuity.
In particular, we specify a prior that these constants can only take values in the interval $[0, 1]$. 
We remain agnostic as to which values within that interval are more plausible in the prior.
The result is a uniform prior over possible win probabilities, which we apply to both intercept parameters.
\begin{align}
  \alpha_{w = 0}, \alpha_{w = 1} &\sim \mathrm{Uniform}\left(0, 1\right)
  (\#eq:const-uniform-prior)
\end{align}
The structural information in this prior is indisputable.
We know with certainty that no probability can be less than $0$ or greater than $1$.
Accordingly, this prior concentrates probability density away from treatment effects that cannot be true, while maintaining the local linear specification that is justified by the limiting intuition of the key identification assumption.
Because we give flat priors to the individual intercepts rather than the treatment effect itself, the implied prior for the treatment effect inherits the triangular shape introduced above in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-diff-means-example), which is vague despite not being flat. 

We complete the model by specifying distributions for the outcome data and the remaining parameters. 
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  y_{dpt} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}\left(\alpha_{w[dpt]} + \beta_{w[dpt]}(\text{Extremist Primary Margin})_{dpt}, \sigma \right) \\
  \mathrm{\beta_{w}} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}\left(0, 10\right) \\ 
  \sigma &\sim \mathrm{Uniform}(0, 10)
\end{split}
(\#eq:constrained-aux-priors)
\end{align}
The Normal model for the outcome data in the first line is equivalent to the Normal error term defined in \@ref(eq:bayes-rd).
The priors for the $\beta_{w}$ slopes and residual standard deviation $\sigma$ are very diffuse given the scale of the outcome data, $\{0, 1\}$, and the running variable that only takes values in the interval $[`r -100 * bandwidth_margin`, `r 100 * bandwidth_margin`]$, a bandwidth of $\pm 5$ percentage points around the threshold.

A possible retort to this model setup is a Bayesian approach would be entirely unnecessary if instead we employed a binary outcome model like logit or probit regression.
These models are typically used to estimate probabilities underlying binary data in other contexts, so we entertain it here as well.
Although this model contradicts the limiting intuition that the regression function is instantaneously linear at the discontinuity (as any function is instantaneously linear for an infinitesimal change in its input), I indulge this possible retort by building a Bayesian logit specification as well. 
This setup considers the binary election result as a Bernoulli variable with a probability parameter specified by a logit model,
\begin{align}
  y_{dpt} &\sim \mathrm{Bernoulli}\left(\pi_{dpt}\right) \\
  \mathrm{logit}\left(\pi_{dpt}\right) 
  &= \alpha^{*}_{w[dpt]} + \beta^{*}_{w[dpt]}(\text{Extremist Primary Margin})_{dpt}
  (\#eq:rd-logit-likelihood)
\end{align}
with parameters denoted $\alpha_{w}^{*}$ and $\beta_{w}^{*}$ to distinguish them from the $\alpha_{w}$ and $\beta_{w}$ parameters in the linear setup.

Although this logit specification constrains all win probability estimates to fall in the appropriate region, specifying priors for logit models is more challenging because regression parameters are defined on the log-odds scale instead of the probability scale.
Fortunately for the case of regression discontinuity, the treatment effect is defined at the threshold where the running variable is $0$, so our prior for the treatment effect can be constructed in a region of parameter space where the running variable and its coefficients have dropped from the equation.
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
  \mathrm{logit}\left(\pi_{dpt}\right) 
  &= \alpha^{*}_{w[dpt]} \text{, at Extremist Primary Margin}_{dpt} = 0 \\
  \text{which implies } \pi_{dpt} &= \mathrm{logit}^{-1}\left(\alpha_{w[dpt]}\right) 
\end{split}
(\#eq:rd-logit-x0)
\end{align}
If we want to construct a prior for the treatment effect that is similar to the structural information we encoded in the linear specification, we must specify priors for the extremist and non-extremist win probabilities that are flat over valid probability values at the discontinuity.
This requires a prior for $\alpha^{*}_{w}$ on the log-odds scale that implies a flat prior for $\mathrm{logit}^{-1}\left(\alpha_{w}^{*}\right)$ on the probability scale.
To solve this problem, we leverage the logit model's connection to the standard Logistic distribution.
The logit function maps values in the $(0, 1)$ interval to any real number, and the inverse logit function maps any real number to $(0, 1)$.
We accomplish a flat prior for win probabilities at the threshold using a a standard Logistic prior on the log-odds scale,
\begin{align}
  \alpha_{w}^{*} &\sim \mathrm{Logistic}\left(0, 1\right)
  (\#eq:logit-prior)
\end{align}
which becomes a flat density for $\mathrm{logit}^{-1}\left(\alpha_{w}^{*}\right)$. 
It is startling at first to consider a prior as narrow as $\mathrm{Logistic}\left(0, 1\right)$ as an uninformative prior for a key parameter. 
But at discussed in Section \@ref(sec:prior-flatness), the connection between prior vagueness and prior flatness is not absolute.
Flatness is only a shape. The relationship between flatness and informativeness depends on model parameterization and the scale of the data.

Figure \@ref(fig:plot-logit-priors) visualizes how the Logistic prior for the intercept on the log-odds scale becomes a flat prior on the probability scale at the threshold.
The left panel shows a histogram of $\mathrm{Logistic}\left(0, 1\right)$ simulations, and the right panel shows a histogram of the same values after they are converted to probabilities using the inverse logit function. 
For comparison, I also simulate a $\mathrm{Normal}\left(0, 10\right)$ prior, which is something a researcher might pick if they wanted to be vague on the log-odds scale. 
Converting the wide Normal prior to the probability scale, however, shows that greater prior density on logit values far from zero translates to greater prior density over probability values very close to $0$ and $1$.

The fact that the wide Normal prior has strange behavior on the probability scale does not mean that it shouldn't be used in Bayesian logistic modeling.
It could be an appropriate choice for specifying priors for constructs that should be understood directly on the logit scale.
For instance, I give this exact prior to the slope parameters in this RDD logit model, 
\begin{align}
  \beta_{w} &\sim \mathrm{Normal}\left(0, 10\right)
\end{align}
because I want the prior to consider a broader distribution slopes _on the logit-scale_.
The lesson with these priors, as with any prior, is that prior distributions should be chosen to suit the modeling context.
Elements of that context include link functions, model reparameterization, the scaling of outcome data or covariates, regularization concerns, and so on.
Choosing "default priors" that always encode flatness on one scale has no guaranteed behavior for implies priors for important functions of parameters.

These prior interventions in both the Bayesian LPM and the Bayesian logit are minor.
They merely encode structural information about the outcome scale.
Win probabilities for extremists and non-extremists are constrained to take valid values—between $0$ and $1$—but the prior is otherwise agnostic about which win probabilities are more likely than others before seeing any data. 
What effect do these minor interventions have? 
Figure \@ref(fig:plot-rdd-results) plots the results from these three Bayesian models: the problematic original model with improper flat priors, the Bayesian LPM with structural priors to constrain the intercepts, and the logit model that creates the structural prior using the transformed Logistic distribution.
The left panel shows a histogram of posterior MCMC samples for the non-extremist win probability at the threshold.
The LPM at the top of the panel included no parameter constraints whatsoever.
As a result, we see the pathological behavior where the posterior distribution places positive density on win probabilities that we know with certainty to be impossible to obtain.
The histograms in the second and third rows show the LPM and logit with the structural prior.
Both models concentrate prior density on possible win probabilities only, resulting in posterior distributions that reflect prior information better than the unconstrained model.
The posterior distributions are asymmetric and place a lot of posterior density at high win probabilities, but this should not alarm us.
The asymmetry in the distribution reflects the signals obtained from the data, rationalized against weak information encoded in the prior. 
The asymmetry is direct indicator of the way Bayesian priors added value to the analysis.

The right panel of Figure \@ref(fig:plot-rdd-results) shows how these parameter constrains ultimately manifest in our LATE estimates by plotting posterior means and $90$ percent compatibility intervals for each model.
As with nearly all Bayesian modeling approaches, our priors have the effect of shrinking important effects toward $0$ and reducing the variance of the effect.
In this particular case, the posterior mean for the local average treatment effect shrinks from 
`r 
(flat_mean <- tidy_rdd %>% 
  filter(term == "trt_effect" & model == "Bayes LPM: flat prior") %>% 
  pull(estimate) %>% 
  round(2))
` 
with flat/unconstrained priors to 
`r 
(lpm_mean <- tidy_rdd %>% 
  filter(term == "trt_effect" & model == "Bayes LPM: structural prior") %>% 
  pull(estimate) %>% 
  round(2))
`
using the LPM with constrained intercepts: a 
`r 
  (-1*(abs(lpm_mean) - abs(flat_mean)) / abs(flat_mean)) %>%
  scales::percent(accuracy = 1)
`
reduction in the magnitude of the effect.
The LATE from the Bayesian logit is 
`r 
(logit_mean <- tidy_rdd %>% 
  filter(term == "trt_effect" & model == "Bayes Logit: structural prior") %>% 
  pull(estimate) %>% 
  round(2))
`, 
which is a 
`r 
  (-1*(abs(logit_mean) - abs(flat_mean)) / abs(flat_mean)) %>%
  scales::percent(accuracy = 1)
`
reduction in magnitude. 
This shrinkage comes from the fact that some of the largest treatment effects in our original posterior distribution were composed of impossible parameters.
This manifested earlier in Figure \@ref(fig:plot-flat-effect), which showed that larger treatment effects were more likely to contain pathological parameters than the smaller treatment effects.
The standard deviation of the posterior samples is reduced for the models with structural prior constraints, so these prior interventions are also improving the precision of our estimates.
This is because a fair amount of posterior uncertainty in the unconstrained model was owed to impossible parameter values.

```{r plot-rdd-results, include = TRUE, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "Comparison of posterior samples from Bayesian models with improper flat priors and weakly informative priors. Weakly informative models have flat priors over valid win probabilities at the discontinuity. Priors reduce effect magnitudes and variances by ruling out impossible win probabilities."}
```

It bears emphasizing that the prior interventions in this case study were no more controversial than declaring what is already known: probabilities lie between $0$ and $1$.
Since many causal research designs estimate treatment effects on binary variables, and many causal research designs are limited to small numbers of relevant real-world observations or budget-limited experimental samples, simple interventions like this have the potential to substantially improve the precision of research findings in contexts where researchers do not realize how much information they are leaving out of their analyses.
