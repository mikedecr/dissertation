Sort APW comments:

- Devin:
    - conceptual/term clarity in the beginning: who are partisans? are they primary voters or not necessarily? What is "district partisanship" and how is it different from partisan ideology?
    - How sensitive are the ideal points to item inclusion?
    - Discuss weighting more?
    - Throwing around "getting preferences into government"
    - When would primaries _not_ work? How can you reframe the question to focus energy?
    - Improve the way I talk about "strategic" vs. "representation" using DIME scores. 
    - Where do informal party networks enter the causal graph that I'm positing (Ch 4?)
    - Where is incumbency in the Ch 4 graph?
    - We care about the full effect and the direct effect.
- Evan:
    - who votes in primaries? ideological differences? What do we know about this?
    - Open/Closed primaries?
- Rochelle: 
- Blake: 
    - Measure the incidence of challengers within district-party over time. Are there districts that have a stronger history of challengers? What would this matter? (outward pressure?)
- Ken:
    - we care about the distance between parties/candidates in the same district. 
- Dave: 
    - simulate individual-within-district distribution to compare to the "true distribution of preferences" like Fiorina et al.
    - Show IRFs to tell us which issues are most informative.
    - (List of items; status quo coding? "stay the same" is a conservative coding?)
- Ellie:
    - who is a partisan? are we talking leaners?
    - The uncorrelatedness is worth interrogating more (hierarchical coefficients, build MNorm prior)
    - Power calculation (how to even think about this? stress test the simulation?)
- Barry, what's the "stated purpose" of primaries
    - Entry point is primaries and polarization, but there could be more
    - Citizens? Not just citizens. Constituents? Put definition in chapter 1.
    - what are the Dime scores, what are the details, etc.
    - Candidate "status" vs. incumbency status
    - DIME is an acronym, maybe call them CF score
    - primary institutions
        - timing of the primary. Things that bring people to the primary, presidential / gubernatorial primaries affecting turnout, which could have down-ballot effects
        - Rosenstone Hansen 1993 model of timing and turnout
    - margin histogram in the rank plot
        - ggplot
        - Jackman who's the most liberal senator
    - Selection bias in the CFscores
        - make an argument from the literature about where these things are going
        - Danielle Thomsen?
    - VoteSmart data from Rogowski

    - [ ] Ellie
    - [ ] Ken
    - [ ] Alex

Some readings:

- Achenâ€“Bartels lit review
- Devil email
- Daron Shaw thermometer dimensions
- Bafumi Gelman correlated ranefs/ what are they
- Between/within estimators for causal inference
- DAGs for fixefs/ranefs
- Algorithmic covariate selection
    - Books at home
    - Justify covariate adjustment w/ cites
- Bailey ranefs/incidental parameters (get this 100% right)


Model questions:

- including the group-level means of lower-level covariates as a way of absorbing correlation?
- what about pooling toward something not normal?
- Dynamics:
    - biannual estimate, pool within decade
    - each new redistricting is a new set of things
    - Coefs remember time, districts don't
- Weighted likelihood
    - can we calculate weighted $s^{*}$ without going through $\bar{y}^{*}$
- Notation questions
    - notation for the hierarchical model and cell weights? i in some set? s[g]?
- [ ] identifiability in heteroskedastic model



Data things 

- Adler data (codebook_district_data.pdf)


_Never did finish sending people that new table of contents._


Keep organizing this...


- **Theory/Writing**
    - [ ] candidates fear "idiosyncratic" issues
    - [ ] cite bailey for ranef approach (incidental parameters problem)
    - [ ] vector form covariates in model math section
    - [ ] more cites in model chapter
        - Londregan
    - [ ] what's the deal with equal bill locations?
        - alpha = 0
        - beta also = 0?
        - there are also other ways to get alpha = 0 that aren't equidistant 
    - [ ] first references: MCMC, IRT, SPD
    - [ ] is the "zero point" the "center" of ideology
    - [ ] mimic Stimson's dichotomization
        - see also Ansolabehere, Rodden, Snyder
    - [ ] where else could we do this (measurement scales)

    - [ ] same cache path for pdf/html (less storage)
        - look up bookdown docs on this
        - code idea is in `knitr-helpers.R`
    - [ ] factors/index for groups, items, states, etc. aren't sorted

    - [ ] hack to the end of the simulation exercise
    - [ ] simulation: within-district variance should be an afterthought after the distribution of averages...
        - variance within group should be greater than between
        - does this mean that the exercise is dumb?
    - [x] log1m/log1p functions for probit link
        - doesn't need this?

   - Barry may have SOME stuff
 + candidates
  * [ ] num. house seats vs primary races
  * [ ] districts w/ competitive race
  * [ ] NOMINATE: party switches, death and retirements
   - check double districts, lowest ICPSR number is the 
   - if the member served previously, they would have an older ICPSR number
   - who's missing from DIME
   - Sara Treul's data on primaries
 + secondary theta
  * [x] email Caughey/Warshaw
  * [ ] Seth Hill
- Model
 + setup
  * [ ] weighted binomial (input?)
  * [ ] dynamic
  * [ ] issue priors
 + testing
  * [ ] relaxed priors (rank order?)
  * [ ] real data
  * [ ] prior predictive check
  * [ ] posterior predictive check
- Writing
 + [ ] just start in on Chapter 1?
 + [ ] Rmd the simulation
   + static homoskedastic? heteroskedastic?
   + dynamic heteroskedastic
- Designs
 + Redistricting
  * depends on fineness of ideal pt data
  * Crespin, Jamie Carson, GIS overlap/changing lines, where is variation coming from (e.g. within states)
 + primaries vs caucuses


If we meet in a week: 

- read Sarah Treul
 + still do more of that
- Seth Hill
 + *keep reading*
- Investigate Boatright data
 + *downloaded primary data*
 + *reserved or requested three books on primaries*
- Investigate conventions data
 + *DO*
- Coverage of PP data, DIME
 + *DO?*
- Poll data (investigate CW code, Lax and Phillips)
 + *keep chugging*
 + *clerically organizing their work*
 + *looking at the code*
- meet Kang
 + *investigate him in advance of the 7th*
 + *investigate which group is bringing him in, (Rob Yablon?)*


Goals for next week:

- Roper and Lax/Phillips, Caughey and Warshaw
 + good to find out the scope
- Boatright data reconciliation
- think about multidimensionality
- think about missing data across firm
  + is Stimson a model for dealing with missing data across polls
- vote smart or VoteView or Shor scores for linking giving patterns to policy content
  + more survey cleaning (A.S.S. paper)


What to do with the Hopkins/Sniderman theory

- does party's issue emphasis mean parties should collapse, or that variation should track
- Grossman-Hopkins; parties care about issues so they try to position themselves on it
  + read their stuff to see how they quality this
  + do they think districts collapse?
- weighting issues: left groups see fine variation in left members, but republicans are all bunched at zero (Brunell? Linda Fowler?)
- or Sniderman conflicted theory: Democrats are conflicted about appeasing groups, so variation matters. Republicans are conflicted
- THINK about abortion as a toy case
  + if weighting
- falsify rather than support
  + *make falsification*


*don't forget about Vox*




Threads

- Data
 + secondary Thetas
  * nationalization
  * Seth hill primaries
  * Hill and Tausanovitch
 + primary elections
- lit
 + brady han pope
 + hirano qjps
 + rogowski and langella


Data problems:

- districts
  + figure out how to match districts across time? district IDs?
  + is this handled by incumbency? Does voteview take care of it?



# Meeting June 22, 2018 (Barry)

Agenda:

1. What I have
2. Where to go
    - Roper API
      + workflow: 
      + API to download the data
      + write some code that accepts (1) dataset name (2) list of item responses (3) weight variable
      + as long as I know the variable names, I hit the go button and it should pluck everything out 
    - Design-focused reading
      + (1) Candidate positioning as f(district)
      + (2) Voter choice as f(district - candidate)
      + (3) Candidate positioning and voter choice as f(delta(district))
3. Bigger problems
    - progress
    - motivation
    - use of skills and creativity
      + do I have alternatives
    - broader career concerns
      + is publication stupid?


1. mess with the priors
2. CCES 
3. Making it grow over time
