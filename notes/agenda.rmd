- boatright

is district in NAES

When did CCAP run



## Qs for Alex

- best linear predictor (argmin MSE) in a binary treatment case?
    - is this just an in/out of sample thing?
- what does it mean for a model to estimate a regularizing prior?
    - beta ~ normal(0, alpha); alpha ~ cauchy(0, tau), tau ~ ?
    - Is this just overfitting, or what?
    - I'm doing LOO to guard against model complexity
- Sparsity-inducing priors as an approximation to "dropout"
- priors and likelihoods
    - relating arithmetic mean to beta-binomial model:
        - the arithmetic mean the same as the MAP under...beta(1, 1) prior?
        - how does the beta(.5, .5) prior relate to nonparametric estimation of the proportion?

##  Methods

Bayes and causal inference

- Maclaren identifiability
- Zigler et al 2013: two stage Bayes
- Bayesian causal inf (Oganisian, etc)
- other cool hypothesis reframing stuff
    - TOST equivalence test of assumptions
    - Caughey NPC, beyond sharp null
- design uncertainty
- Gelman King (Bayesian causal inf in political science?)
- Pearl: "half-Bayesian"
- bayes holes
- kang whoever demystifying double robustness
- imbens rubin 1997
- king measurement error
- bayes do-calc papers
- rubin 1984: bayes frequency
- objective bayes back and forth


Neural Nets

- residual debiasing (athey et al)
- Bayesian view/uncertainty
- Regularization approaches
    - Simpson et al. "Penalizing Model Complexity"
    - what is "dropout"
    - can I approximate dropout
    - sparsity priors, regularizing priors, etc.
- Discrete choice models
- Model avging over multiple models
- Hartford et al. counterfactual prediction


Broad ML

- tree models for p.s. (montgomery et al)



Meta-Analysis

- ranefs meta-analysis
    - the Borenstein estimator seems deterministic? is this obtained by an infinite variance prior?
    - what choices are we making with the Bayesian (Rubin) view? compromise between flat prior and spike prior?
    - std.err of estimator is the average wrongness from truth, but we don't know what side of the wrongness we're on



## Ch 1 and other design stuff

Primaries and representation:

- cited in brady, han, and pope
    - A.s.s.
    - fiorina 1999
    - galderisi, ezra, lyons 2001
    - hacker/pearson 2005
    - MPR 2006
    - Bradyand Schwartz1995
    - burden 2001
    - francis et al 2004
    - gerber/morton 1998
    - schmidt, kenny, morton 1996
- evidence of primary extremism
    - presidentials: Norrander1989; Polsbyand Wildavsky1978
    - extremism of presidential delegates: McClosky, Hoffman,and O'Hara 1960; Soule and McGrath 1975; Stone and Rapoport 1994
    - SPD in primaries: Aldrich 1995;PolsbyandWildavsky2004; Schlesinger1991
- Brady/Han/Pope SPD:
    - primary preferences must differ
        - Senate: BradyandSchwartz1995; Francis etal. 1994 ; GerberandMorton1998; Schmidt,Kenny,Morton 1996; 
        - House: scant evidence
    - they must present a _credible threat_
        - general election vote losses principle (Canes-WroneB,radya,ndCogan2002) should apply to the primary, no?
        - moderate candidates _attract_ primary threat (endogeneity)
        - costs of flip-flopping on candidate reputations, clarity of positions: Alvarez1997
- Burden 2001:
    - candidates view of the world vs. voter view: be on your best behavior to not give opponents ammo and fend off challenges. Voters not noticing is actually a _best-case_ scenario.
    - "As long as legislators think that positions matter, then researchers should treat them as though they do"
    - overreaction to the circumstances on the ground is actually equilibrium! So the "unreasonableness" of legislator behavior in the face of voter ignorance or apathy is actually the equilibrium path that the legislator wants to be on, otherwise they could be caught behaving badly and have their voters be made aware.
    - some evidence that legislators are more extreme when they have primary challengers


Formal models that explain divergence:

- Aldrich 1983,
- Alesina 1988,
- Calvert 1985
- Wittman 1977
- Cox 1990: centripetal and centrifugal

- Districts and representation
    - Ensley AJPS, public choice, district complexity/heterogeneity

Other things to come back to:

- porter and treul
- Desmarais et al EPN




# Data agenda

- check on primary laws again, potentially resolve with Barry
- dynamic model, past data




# Modeling agenda


## Neural Net

- choose covariates in hidden layer, or hierarchical coefficients
    - might not be worth it but hey that's ML baybee!
- Combining subposteriors
    - Kernel estimator
    - GP estimator
    - firefly MCMC
- parameterization: do we need covariates in stage 2
- identifiability
        - identifiability paper
        - run for longer, with thinning
        - simulate fake data to see that predictions work even if the parameters look bad

# Writing Thoughts:

Theory: 

- how to set this up as falsification focus rather than verification focus
    - severe tests


# The Wild west


- Alex:
    - More practical question: what's the best strategy for regularizing a in a bayesian causal workflow

    - posterior ideal points
        - estimate MVnormal for ideal points
    - identifiability
        - identifiability paper
        - run for longer, with thinning
        - simulate fake data to see that predictions work even if the parameters look bad
    - two stage
        - send alex paper
    - _Check notebook_
    - identifiability/comparing chains in NN
        - particle filter/genetic algorithm thing to resample chains according to relative posterior probability? 
        - get a marginal likelihood for each chain (harmonic mean estimator, kind of problematic (newton-raftery)), supposed to be 1 number across chains, but you can hack it by looking across chains.
        - or bridge sampling for "approximately correct" marginal likelihood estimator
        - estimate a separate model for different assumptions, use marginal likelihood to reweight estimates
    - how to understand "BART is a prior"?
        - is it just to say that all models are priors for (new) data?
    - conditional logit:
        - is this the right direction to go?
        - All predictors are differences from baseline, or no? just the SUM of one utility is normalized?
        - can size of choice set vary across sets?
        - can the choices themselves be different across sets (have different sets of features)? Doesn't seem like it has to, it's just that I'm imposing fixed coefficients
        - what's the deal with IIA? Choice utility (or probability) ratios are unaffected by presence of additional choices?
        - making it in stan:
            - <https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm/blob/master/src/stan_files/functions/bernoulli_likelihoods.stan>
            - <https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm/blob/master/src/stan_files/bernoulli.stan>
    - Regularization-induced confounding in a neural net?
    - How to think about cross-validation in Bayes context?
        - how to even think about regularization in a neural net?
        - do I fit several models and only predict for units not in the model?
        - _weird how this is probably how things should **always** be done?_
- Barry:
    - check primary candidate quality
    - possible to scrape candidate quality for primary candidates from: Ballotpedia, FEC, Open Secrets
- Ellie:
    - send ch 2

## for writing

- 1. Theory
    - conceptual/term clarity in the beginning
        - who are "partisans" in my groups? (primary voters?)
        - What is "district partisanship" vs. policy ideology?
    - Definition of representation 
        - I only have ideology, not a 1-1 measure of candidate issue congruence or government policy congruence
    - Big view:
        - When would primaries _not_ work? How can you reframe the question to focus energy?
- 2. Model
    - incorporate earlier Barry edits (symlinked)
- 3. Causal Inference 
    - arguments in favor: integrating a loss function over a posterior distribution
    - lots you can read in the Aronow/Miller book!

    - Justify ML in theory:
        - Two-stage modeling for selection
            - regression weights
            - regularization-induced confounding
        - Functional form
            - we don't know the relationships between covariates
            - we can actually get around more difficult LIKELIHOOD assumptions with sufficient functional agnosticism w/r/t covariates
    - Empirical demo of problems?
        - Justify ML using RMSE in predicting an exposure?
        - In vs. out of sample performance
    - Decide about two-stage modeling
    - Covariates
        - include other district
        - more polarization in parties -> what does this do to positioning?

# Project-level tasks

- [ ] clean agenda
- [ ] Model excerpt to Ellie
- [ ] Wagner







# Comments to sort

- Devin:
    - Where do informal party networks enter the causal graph that I'm positing (Ch 4?)
    - Where is incumbency in the Ch 4 graph?
    - We care about the full effect and the direct effect.
- Evan:
    - who votes in primaries? ideological differences? What do we know about this?
    - Open/Closed primaries?
- Rochelle: 
- Blake: 
    - Measure the incidence of challengers within district-party over time. Are there districts that have a stronger history of challengers? What would this matter? (outward pressure?)
- Ken:
    - we care about the distance between parties/candidates in the same district. 
- Dave: 
    - simulate individual-within-district distribution to compare to the "true distribution of preferences" like Fiorina et al.
    - Show IRFs to tell us which issues are most informative.
    - (List of items; status quo coding? "stay the same" is a conservative coding?)
- Ellie:
    - who is a partisan? are we talking leaners?
    - The uncorrelatedness is worth interrogating more (hierarchical coefficients, build MNorm prior)
    - Power calculation (how to even think about this? stress test the simulation?)
- Barry, what's the "stated purpose" of primaries
    - Entry point is primaries and polarization, but there could be more
    - Citizens? Not just citizens. Constituents? Put definition in chapter 1.
    - what are the Dime scores, what are the details, etc.
    - Candidate "status" vs. incumbency status
    - DIME is an acronym, maybe call them CF score
    - primary institutions
        - timing of the primary. Things that bring people to the primary, presidential / gubernatorial primaries affecting turnout, which could have down-ballot effects
        - Rosenstone Hansen 1993 model of timing and turnout
    - margin histogram in the rank plot
        - ggplot
        - Jackman who's the most liberal senator
    - Selection bias in the CFscores
        - make an argument from the literature about where these things are going
