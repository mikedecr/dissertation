# Meetings

Urgent methods reading agenda

- zigler et al 2013: two stage bayes
- bayesian causal inf (oganisian, etc)
- neural nets
- choice models
- neural net + choice
- design uncertainty
- other cool hypothesis reframing stuff
    - TOST equivalence test of assumptions
    - Caughey NPC, beyond sharp null
- tree models for p.s. (montgomery et al)
- check on primary laws again, potentially resolve with Barry


- Alex:
    - couldn't you have chooser covariates in the hidden layer, since it's transformed?
    - relating arithmetic mean to beta-binomial model:
        - the arithmetic mean the same as the MAP under...beta(1, 1) prior?
        - how does the beta(.5, .5) prior relate to nonparametric estimation of the proportion?
    - posterior ideal points
        - estimate MVnormal for ideal points
    - identifiability
        - identifiability paper
        - run for longer, with thinning
        - simulate fake data to see that predictions work even if the parameters look bad
    - two stage
        - send alex paper
    - _Check notebook_
    - identifiability/comparing chains in NN
        - particle filter/genetic algorithm thing to resample chains according to relative posterior probability? 
        - get a marginal likelihood for each chain (harmonic mean estimator, kind of problematic (newton-raftery)), supposed to be 1 number across chains, but you can hack it by looking across chains.
        - or bridge sampling for "approximately correct" marginal likelihood estimator
        - estimate a separate model for different assumptions, use marginal likelihood to reweight estimates
    - how to understand "BART is a prior"?
        - is it just to say that all models are priors for (new) data?
    - conditional logit:
        - is this the right direction to go?
        - All predictors are differences from baseline, or no? just the SUM of one utility is normalized?
        - can size of choice set vary across sets?
        - can the choices themselves be different across sets (have different sets of features)? Doesn't seem like it has to, it's just that I'm imposing fixed coefficients
        - what's the deal with IIA? Choice utility (or probability) ratios are unaffected by presence of additional choices?
        - making it in stan:
            - <https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm/blob/master/src/stan_files/functions/bernoulli_likelihoods.stan>
            - <https://github.com/stan-dev/rstanarm/blob/master/src/stan_files/bernoulli.stan>
    - Regularization-induced confounding in a neural net?
    - How to think about cross-validation in Bayes context?
        - how to even think about regularization in a neural net?
        - do I fit several models and only predict for units not in the model?
        - _weird how this is probably how things should **always** be done?_
- Barry:
    - check primary candidate quality
    - possible to scrape candidate quality for primary candidates from: Ballotpedia, FEC, Open Secrets
- Ellie:
    - send ch 2

## for writing

- 1. Theory
    - conceptual/term clarity in the beginning
        - who are "partisans" in my groups? (primary voters?)
        - What is "district partisanship" vs. policy ideology?
    - Definition of representation 
        - I only have ideology, not a 1-1 measure of candidate issue congruence or government policy congruence
    - Big view:
        - When would primaries _not_ work? How can you reframe the question to focus energy?
- 2. Model
    - incorporate earlier Barry edits (symlinked)
- 3. Causal Inference 
    - arguments in favor: integrating a loss function over a posterior distribution
    - lots you can read in the Aronow/Miller book!
- 4. Positioning
    - "strategic" vs. sincere "representation" with DIME scores


## for analysis

- Ch 4;
    - Justify ML in theory:
        - Two-stage modeling for selection
            - regression weights
            - regularization-induced confounding
        - Functional form
            - we don't know the relationships between covariates
            - we can actually get around more difficult LIKELIHOOD assumptions with sufficient functional agnosticism w/r/t covariates
    - Empirical demo of problems?
        - Justify ML using RMSE in predicting an exposure?
        - In vs. out of sample performance
    - Decide about two-stage modeling
    - Covariates
        - include other district
        - more polarization in parties -> what does this do to positioning?

## for data

- Fix 2010s poll data (multinomial response, midpoints, **barry**)
    - see Stimson notes
    - also Ansolabahere, Rodden, Stewart public IRT
- Gather 2000s poll data
- How sensitive are the ideal points to item inclusion? (cross-validate?)
- Discuss weighting more?
- Secondary data:
    - party nationalization
    - hill/tausanovitch
    - seth hill individual ideal points
- Stimson and thermostat model
    - how he deals w/ multiple polls, missing data
    - also dichotomization



# Project-level tasks

- [ ] clean agenda
- [ ] Model excerpt to Ellie
- [ ] Wagner







# Comments to sort

- Devin:
    - Where do informal party networks enter the causal graph that I'm positing (Ch 4?)
    - Where is incumbency in the Ch 4 graph?
    - We care about the full effect and the direct effect.
- Evan:
    - who votes in primaries? ideological differences? What do we know about this?
    - Open/Closed primaries?
- Rochelle: 
- Blake: 
    - Measure the incidence of challengers within district-party over time. Are there districts that have a stronger history of challengers? What would this matter? (outward pressure?)
- Ken:
    - we care about the distance between parties/candidates in the same district. 
- Dave: 
    - simulate individual-within-district distribution to compare to the "true distribution of preferences" like Fiorina et al.
    - Show IRFs to tell us which issues are most informative.
    - (List of items; status quo coding? "stay the same" is a conservative coding?)
- Ellie:
    - who is a partisan? are we talking leaners?
    - The uncorrelatedness is worth interrogating more (hierarchical coefficients, build MNorm prior)
    - Power calculation (how to even think about this? stress test the simulation?)
- Barry, what's the "stated purpose" of primaries
    - Entry point is primaries and polarization, but there could be more
    - Citizens? Not just citizens. Constituents? Put definition in chapter 1.
    - what are the Dime scores, what are the details, etc.
    - Candidate "status" vs. incumbency status
    - DIME is an acronym, maybe call them CF score
    - primary institutions
        - timing of the primary. Things that bring people to the primary, presidential / gubernatorial primaries affecting turnout, which could have down-ballot effects
        - Rosenstone Hansen 1993 model of timing and turnout
    - margin histogram in the rank plot
        - ggplot
        - Jackman who's the most liberal senator
    - Selection bias in the CFscores
        - make an argument from the literature about where these things are going

# Barry 10/12

- Data
 + states
  * [ ] primary type (Rogowski and Langella, Masket et al 2014)
  * [ ] primary institution
  * [ ] pre-nomination conventions
   - Barry may have SOME stuff
 + candidates
  * [ ] num. house seats vs primary races
  * [ ] districts w/ competitive race
  * [ ] NOMINATE: party switches, death and retirements
   - check double districts, lowest ICPSR number is the 
   - if the member served previously, they would have an older ICPSR number
   - who's missing from DIME
   - Sara Treul's data on primaries
 + secondary theta
  * [x] email Caughey/Warshaw
  * [ ] Seth Hill
- Model
 + setup
  * [ ] weighted binomial (input?)
  * [ ] dynamic
  * [ ] issue priors
 + testing
  * [ ] relaxed priors (rank order?)
  * [ ] real data
  * [ ] prior predictive check
  * [ ] posterior predictive check
- Writing
 + [ ] just start in on Chapter 1?
 + [ ] Rmd the simulation
   + static homoskedastic? heteroskedastic?
   + dynamic heteroskedastic
- Designs
 + Redistricting
  * depends on fineness of ideal pt data
  * Crespin, Jamie Carson, GIS overlap/changing lines, where is variation coming from (e.g. within states)
 + primaries vs caucuses


If we meet in a week: 

- read Sarah Treul
 + still do more of that
- Seth Hill
 + *keep reading*
- Investigate Boatright data
 + *downloaded primary data*
 + *reserved or requested three books on primaries*
- Investigate conventions data
 + *DO*
- Coverage of PP data, DIME
 + *DO?*
- Poll data (investigate CW code, Lax and Phillips)
 + *keep chugging*
 + *clerically organizing their work*
 + *looking at the code*
- meet Kang
 + *investigate him in advance of the 7th*
 + *investigate which group is bringing him in, (Rob Yablon?)*


Goals for next week:

- Roper and Lax/Phillips, Caughey and Warshaw
 + good to find out the scope
- think about missing data across firm
    + is Stimson a model for dealing with missing data across polls
- vote smart or VoteView or Shor scores for linking giving patterns to policy content
  + more survey cleaning (A.S.S. paper)


What to do with the Hopkins/Sniderman theory

- does party's issue emphasis mean parties should collapse, or that variation should track
- Grossman-Hopkins; parties care about issues so they try to position themselves on it
  + read their stuff to see how they quality this
  + do they think districts collapse?
- weighting issues: left groups see fine variation in left members, but republicans are all bunched at zero (Brunell? Linda Fowler?)
- or Sniderman conflicted theory: Democrats are conflicted about appeasing groups, so variation matters. Republicans are conflicted
- THINK about abortion as a toy case
  + if weighting
- falsify rather than support
  + *make falsification*
