# Today

- [ ] ask Alex about: 
    - identifiability in heteroskedastic model
    - hierarchical priors for item parameters?
        - CW do *not* do this
    - variance of normal/logistic in formal model
- Paper fixes
    - [ ] vector form covariates in model math section
    - [ ] IRT model from formal assumptions
    - [ ] more cites in model chapter
        - Londregon
    - [ ] what's the deal with equal bill locations?
        - alpha = 0
        - beta also = 0?
        - there are also other ways to get alpha = 0 that aren't equidistant 
- Code fixes
    - [ ] which params can we avoid saving (in simulation)?
    - [ ] move estimation from "combine data" into sampling file
    - [ ] hack to the end of the simulation exercise
    - [ ] simulation: within-district variance should be an afterthought after the distribution of averages...
        - variance within group should be greater than between
        - does this mean that the exercise is dumb?
- [ ] simulation: should discrimination be "identified" exp(sum(log))
    - For the "first-check dissertation version," YES
        - we want the ICCs to look the same
    - for intense stress-testing, we want NO...
        - priors should be wide but the model will hone it in
- [ ] LICENSE
- [ ] Document-level aesthetic to-dos (some time...)

# Barry 10/12

- Data
 + states
  * [ ] primary type (Rogowski and Langella, Masket et al 2014)
  * [ ] primary institution
  * [ ] pre-nomination conventions
   - Barry may have SOME stuff
 + candidates
  * [ ] num. house seats vs primary races
  * [ ] districts w/ competitive race
  * [ ] NOMINATE: party switches, death and retirements
   - check double districts, lowest ICPSR number is the 
   - if the member served previously, they would have an older ICPSR number
   - who's missing from DIME
   - Sara Treul's data on primaries
 + secondary theta
  * [x] email Caughey/Warshaw
  * [ ] Seth Hill
- Model
 + setup
  * [ ] weighted binomial (input?)
  * [ ] dynamic
  * [ ] issue priors
 + testing
  * [ ] relaxed priors (rank order?)
  * [ ] real data
  * [ ] prior predictive check
  * [ ] posterior predictive check
- Writing
 + [ ] just start in on Chapter 1?
 + [ ] Rmd the simulation
   + static homoskedastic? heteroskedastic?
   + dynamic heteroskedastic
- Designs
 + Redistricting
  * depends on fineness of ideal pt data
  * Crespin, Jamie Carson, GIS overlap/changing lines, where is variation coming from (e.g. within states)
 + primaries vs caucuses


If we meet in a week: 

- read Sarah Treul
 + still do more of that
- Seth Hill
 + *keep reading*
- Investigate Boatright data
 + *downloaded primary data*
 + *reserved or requested three books on primaries*
- Investigate conventions data
 + *DO*
- Coverage of PP data, DIME
 + *DO?*
- Poll data (investigate CW code, Lax and Phillips)
 + *keep chugging*
 + *clerically organizing their work*
 + *looking at the code*
- meet Kang
 + *investigate him in advance of the 7th*
 + *investigate which group is bringing him in, (Rob Yablon?)*


Goals for next week:

- Roper and Lax/Phillips, Caughey and Warshaw
 + good to find out the scope
- Boatright data reconciliation
- think about multidimensionality
- think about missing data across firm
  + is Stimson a model for dealing with missing data across polls
- vote smart or VoteView or Shor scores for linking giving patterns to policy content
  + more survey cleaning (A.S.S. paper)


What to do with the Hopkins/Sniderman theory

- does party's issue emphasis mean parties should collapse, or that variation should track
- Grossman-Hopkins; parties care about issues so they try to position themselves on it
  + read their stuff to see how they quality this
  + do they think districts collapse?
- weighting issues: left groups see fine variation in left members, but republicans are all bunched at zero (Brunell? Linda Fowler?)
- or Sniderman conflicted theory: Democrats are conflicted about appeasing groups, so variation matters. Republicans are conflicted
- THINK about abortion as a toy case
  + if weighting
- falsify rather than support
  + *make falsification*


*don't forget about Vox*




Threads

- Data
 + secondary Thetas
  * nationalization
  * Seth hill primaries
  * Hill and Tausanovitch
 + primary elections
- lit
 + brady han pope
 + hirano qjps
 + rogowski and langella


Data problems:

- districts
  + figure out how to match districts across time? district IDs?
  + is this handled by incumbency? Does voteview take care of it?



# Meeting June 22, 2018 (Barry)

Agenda:

1. What I have
2. Where to go
    - Roper API
      + workflow: 
      + API to download the data
      + write some code that accepts (1) dataset name (2) list of item responses (3) weight variable
      + as long as I know the variable names, I hit the go button and it should pluck everything out 
    - Design-focused reading
      + (1) Candidate positioning as f(district)
      + (2) Voter choice as f(district - candidate)
      + (3) Candidate positioning and voter choice as f(delta(district))
3. Bigger problems
    - progress
    - motivation
    - use of skills and creativity
      + do I have alternatives
    - broader career concerns
      + is publication stupid?


1. mess with the priors
2. CCES 
3. Making it grow over time
