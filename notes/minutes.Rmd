Do:

- keep distilling prospectus
- rethink intro organization
- reorg model chapter lead-in
- make the model dynamic before getting too far into the math
- think about the dynamic simulation
  - should be easy...only thing that changes is the hierarchical parameters
  - (can simulate data in nested DF by time)
- find Hirano and Snyder, "Primary Elections"
- consider having a rhetorical section on the static model for gut-checking
  - it's good to show that you can talk about something clearly and slowly
  - keep the non-ac audience in mind!
- organize readings
- plan your fill times (such as discarding useless readings, or getting one-sentence things out of them and then setting them aside)


Did:

- chapter 1 progress
  - know I need to overhaul
  - tension about how quickly to get past "intro" and into the meat
- chapter 2 progress?
  - some revisions to the flow of the intro
  - some tweaks to model math notation
- collected some more readings
  - need to organize
  - use during your fill time!
- didn't really hit gender gap
- made progress on APSA data / reading up on conjoint
- talked to Bryan Wilcox, talking to his boss next
  - SEA, NYC, DC
  - is the mission aligned with what I want
  - is is the kind of work I'm going to be good at (imposter syndrome about project management)
