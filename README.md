# Do Primaries Work? Bayesian Causal Models of Partisan Ideology and Congressional Nominations

As partisanship increasingly drives general election competition in the U.S., party nomination contests seem increasingly important in determining who represents a district in Congress.
At the same time, many ideas about how primaries affect representation in the U.S. are not supported by empirical research.
Do primary elections faithfully represent the policy preferences of local partisan voters? 

Political scientists believe that candidates for office face a trade-off in the way they position themselves ideologically.
To win the nomination, candidate must champion their party's values, but winning the general election requires the support of a broader cross-section of the electorate.
Political scientists have called termed this the "strategic positioning dilemma"â€”the candidate must be partisan enough to win the nomination, but not so partisan that they lose the general election.

This theory of primaries rests on shaky ground both theoretically and empirically.
Theoretically, primary elections present voters with high informational demands.
Learning the policy positions of different candidates is costly, especially when all candidates share the same party label.
Moreover, a candidate's support among informal networks of party-aligned interest groups may be more important to their nominations than their ideological "fit" with partisan voters in the district.
Empirically, research of representation in primaries is held back by a limited understanding of local partisans' policy preferences.
Most existing research measures voters' preferences using coarse proxies that do not distinguish between Republican and Democratic groups or may not meaningfully capture policy preferences at all.

This dissertation seeks to improve the measurement of the policy preferences of partisan voters at the local level and apply these new measures to the study of representation in primary elections.
Along the way, it exposes and clarifies key causal assumptions at work in prior research, and it explores new methodological tools for the statistical analysis of a broader range of causal inference problems in political science. 



## Goals of this project: 

1. Create novel estimates for the policy preferences of partisan groups within Congressional districts, using customized Bayesian IRT modeling approach.

2. Apply novel estimates of local partisan preferences to test key theoretical claims about representation in primary elections: does the extremism/moderation of local preferences (X) meaningfully affect the extremism/moderation of primary candidates for Congress (Y1) and the extremism/moderation of the candidate eventually nominated to run in the general election (Y2)?

3. Explore a Bayesian framework for causal inference in political science: formal notation, theoretical clarity on the meaning and application of priors, and practical guidance for pragmatic causal inference with Bayesian value-added.

4. Extend Bayesian framework to computational causal inference approaches using machine learning methods, with a focus on structural causal models. Particular emphasis on Bayesian neural network models.

<!-- As general election competition in the U.S. becomes increasingly driven by partisanship, party nomination contests are perhaps more consequential than ever. Yet research on U.S. elections knows little about whether primaries serve their stated purpose: to represent the preferences of local partisan voters. Political scientists believe that primary elections present candidates with a "strategic positioning dilemma"---to win both the nomination and the general election, candidates must position themselves as some spatial compromise between the preferences of their partisan base and the district median voter. This theory of primaries rests on shaky ground both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, primary elections present voters with uniquely high informational demands, and voters may not meet them. Learning the policy positions of candidates is costly, especially when all candidates share the same party label. Moreover, informal party networks may overshadow voter preferences in shaping primary outcomes. Empirically, research on primary representation is hindered by a limited understanding of local partisan preferences. Most existing research measures local preferences using rough proxies that do not distinguish between Republican and Democratic preferences (such as vote shares) or do not operationalize citizen preferences at all.

This dissertation puts the big questions of primary representation to the test using recent data on U.S. House primaries. Do candidates position themselves in response to the ideological median in their partisan constituency? Do partisan constituencies nominate candidates that better match their ideological preferences? These questions are key to understanding primaries, but they are not confronted directly in existing research. This project develops a unique set of ideal point estimates for local "party publics"---partisan groups within districts---by fitting a group-level IRT model to public opinion data in recent election cycles. The model estimates the ideological medians of Republican and Democratic identifiers within districts and the degree of ideological heterogeneity within each group. With direct measures of local partisan preferences, further research can examine the power of individuals vs. groups in shaping nomination contests, the quality of electoral accountability in "safe" districts, and the ideological dimensions along which the two parties compete in primaries. -->
